This repository contains code to
* Perform the cleaning of the annotated data for the mapOSR project (`clean_data.ipynb')
* Create visualizations for various presentations of the project (`create_visualizations.ipynb`)
* Perform the interrater-reliability analysis (`reliability.html`)

The scripts read data files deposited in `data/` and create outputs which are deposited in `data/` (cleaned data files) or `plots/` (visualizations). 

This repository is connected to a [data repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/maposr/about/) which contains
* Data version history
* Annotation codebook
* Cleaned dataset
* Cleaned interrater reliability dataset
* List of references of studies included in the dataset
* The PRISMA flow diagram used for data collection
* The PRISMA checklist used for reporting about the study.
