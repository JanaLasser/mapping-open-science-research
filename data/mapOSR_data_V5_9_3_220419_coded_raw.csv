The study sample was obtained in October 2013. After discarding those that were not published in Spain and those that were inactive, we were left with a total of 406 journals (392 in Scopus and 171 in WoS, with an overlap of 157). Seven key indicators were established: age, subject area, language, publisher, portals, type of access, and copyright. Most of the data were gathered by directly analyzing the websites of the journals. Information from the Dulcinea directory was also used. Most of the journals (63 per cent of the total) were first published after 1980. Universities and commercial publishers were the most significant publishers, accounting for 42 per cent and 31 per cent of all journals, respectively. Social sciences and health sciences were the most significant disciplines, accounting for 33 per cent each. Of the journals, 60 per cent were available free immediately after publication and 76 per cent granted permission for self-archiving a version of the manuscript. By combining the two results, we estimated that 48 per cent of all journals were open access (offering free access and permission for self-archiving).",a=openaccess,m=biblio; m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=ESP,,,"Abadal, Ernest; Melero, Remedios; Rodrigues, Rosangela Schwarz; Navas-Fernandez, Miguel",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING,English,Article,,,,,"[Abadal, Ernest; Navas-Fernandez, Miguel] Univ Barcelona, Fac Lib & Informat Sci, Catalonia, Spain; [Melero, Remedios] Spanish Natl Res Council, Agrochem & Food Technol Inst, Madrid, Spain; [Rodrigues, Rosangela Schwarz] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Grad Program Informat Sci, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Navas-Fernandez, Miguel] Catalonia Govt, Special Libraries, Madrid, Spain",,19,10,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,1198-9742,,2015,47,1,77,96,10.3138/jsp.47.1.04,,,WOS:000086362200007,,2021-01-27

Five major mechanisms of intervention for pursuing OA policies were used to analyze and evaluate the situation: infrastructure and services; information and dissemination; economic incentives; institutional coordination; and regulation or obligation. Data collection was based on a questionnaire sent to the vice-rectors for research of all Spanish universities. This information was supplemented by consulting directories of repositories, Spanish scientific journals, and institutional OA policies. The application of OA policies varies greatly. Spanish universities can be classified into five groups according to the number and quality of the actions taken. The first includes 7 universities (9% of the total) that have a comprehensive OA policy. The second includes 12 universities (16%) with a clear policy. The third includes 17 universities (23%) with an ongoing policy. The fourth includes 17 universities (23%) that have taken one or two actions and therefore have an incipient policy.

Data was collected by a questionnaire (with a response rate of 58% of the publishers associated with UNE) and includes in-depth interviews with seven of them. The results show that 75% of UNE members publish titles in open access, most consider open access a good way to increase the dissemination of monographs, and that there are no differences in content quality with non-open access works.

Recent studies advocated the importance of funding more research on diabetes and insulin in these countries. Recently, the European Research Council advocated the importance of gold Open Access (OA) publishing, where the funded research should be immediately accessible. In this study, we aim to assess funding for insulin research, where we will compare the OA status between funded and unfunded research. Methods: We used Scopus database to assess insulin research published from January 1st, 1999 to December 31 st, 2018. Our bibliometric analysis consisted of three main sections: analysis of all publications on insulin, analysis of funded insulin publications, and analysis of unfunded insulin publications. Results: We found a total of 388,202 publications, of which only 83,180 (21.4%) were funded. USA produced around 30.1% of the total publications, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) was the major funder with 18.6% of all publications. Of the funded publications, 29,143 (35%) were OA publications, compared to 97,347 (31.9%) of the unfunded publications. We didn't find a significant difference in OA status between funded and unfunded research. Conclusion: In concordance with the European Research Council's decision to support gold OA publishing model, we found that only 35% of the funded and 31.9% of the unfunded insulin research were OA. Although the funded research is increasing in China, most of it is produced in high income countries. This highlights the importance of allocating more funds to low/middle income countries.",a=openaccess,m=biblio;  ,d=med,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Abbasi, Hiba; Abu-Farsakh, Noor; Abuazzam, Farah; Halaseh, Rasha; Alaraj, Othman; Hassan, Eman; Al-Essa, Mohammad; AlRyalat, Saif A.",,,,J,,CURRENT DIABETES REVIEWS,English,Article,,,,,"[Abbasi, Hiba; Abu-Farsakh, Noor; Abuazzam, Farah; Halaseh, Rasha; Hassan, Eman] Univ Jordan, Dept Internal Med, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Alaraj, Othman] Univ Jordan, Dept Emergency Med, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Al-Essa, Mohammad] King Hussein Canc Ctr, Amman 11942, Jordan; [AlRyalat, Saif A.] Univ Jordan, Univ Jordan Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Amman 11942, Jordan",,22,0,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,1573-3998,,2020,16,5,497,502,10.2174/1573399815666190712201635,,,WOS:000088639900012,31538901,2021-01-27

Given that one of the ways to analyze the quality of journals and articles is citation indicators, the purpose of this paper is to compare the citation indicators of open access (OA), full subscription and hybrid journals and articles based on the Scopus in the field of library and information science (LIS) for a period of ten years (2004-2013). Design/methodology/approach The research population is all LIS journals and articles in LIS hybrid journals in Scopus. The data related to citation indicators (number of received citations, two years' impact, Citescore [IPP] and H-index) were extracted from Scopus, Journal Metrics and SCImago and analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics with SPSS and Excel. Findings The findings indicate that number of OA journals and articles were less than that of full subscription and hybrid journals. The average rate of all citation indicators in hybrid journals were more than that of OA and full subscription journals. However, in the level of articles, the average number of citations received by OA articles (15.6) was more than that of non-OA articles (2.25). Originality/value Unlike journals, OA seems to be an advantage for articles in LIS. LIS hybrid journals receive more citations than OA and subscription journals. Thus, the authors' approach to publishing in OA, hybrid or subscription journals and the publishers approach to the publication type may also be influenced by the findings of the present study.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=socscie,t=publisher; t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,which discipline does library and information science belong to?; sci-hub; n=197 journals,,"Abbasi, Zahra; Shekofteh, Maryam; Shahbodaghi, Azam; Kazemi, Elaheh",,,,J,,GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AND COMMUNICATION,English,Article,,,,,"[Abbasi, Zahra; Shekofteh, Maryam; Shahbodaghi, Azam] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed Sci, Dept Med Lib & Informat Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Kazemi, Elaheh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed Sci, Dept Biostat, Tehran, Iran",,35,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2514-9342,,2019,68,4-5,288,299,10.1108/GKMC-02-2018-0016,,,WOS:000089667600003,,2021-01-27

Design/methodology/approach- The study employed a mixed method research approach. A survey has been conducted among purposively selected students (52) and faculties (17) through distributing a structured questionnaire(1-5 point likert scale, and open ended).SPSS v.20 and coding method have been used for analyzing quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Findings-Both faculties and students had positive perceptions towards OARs though faculties were more knowledgeable than students in terms of understanding on major OA concepts. Digital format and free availability were considered as motivational factors for using OARs. Both respondents indicated plagiarism and copyright violation as important vulnerabilities in using OARs. Originality/value-This paper highlights the awareness level of faculties and students towards open access resources in higher education in scholarly research. Apart from purposes, sources, preferable model, and state of publication in open access mode, the study focuses on motivational factor, vulnerabilities, and integration of open access resources in higher education and scholarly research from faculties and students perspectives which demonstrateits originality. Implication- It would generate awareness among the academics, library professionals as well as OA publishers topromote OARs for wider use. © 2020 All Rights Reserved",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=other,geo=BGD,https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/4516/?utm_source=digitalcommons.unl.edu%2Flibphilprac%2F4516&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages,,"Abdullah- Al- Mahmud, Eamin Ali Akanda A.K.M., Haque M.A., Eamin Ali Akanda A.K.M., Begum D.",,,,,,Library Philosophy and Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,0,University of Idaho Library,15220222,0,2020,2020,0,1,16,,,,WOS:000165815400001,,2021-01-27

The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (hopes) and negative expectations (fears). These were uncorrelated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations.

With a special focus on academic publishing by African mass communicators, this study interrogates the open access. The key objectives of this study include finding out the number of Africa's communication journals indexed in Open access Scopus platform; mine the data in the global repository and answer the question: how open are open access academic outlets. Applying comparative computational datasets and especially, content analysis, preliminary results showed that less than 5% of both indexers contain Mass Communication journals, compared to the sciences, engineering and others. Curiously, publications by Africa and subscriptions by the continent's higher institutions are similarly low. The study concludes that the negatively skewed presence of local journals and articles in global open access databases should worry Africa's higher institutions in the face of global competition for upper ranking. It recommends urgent convening of conferences, seminars and workshops on global open access offerings with a view to increasing awareness and usage among all Universities in the continent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Escobar, E. Dussel, and S. Castro Gomez. This form of coloniality of knowledge can be subverted by strengthening the practice of knowledge circulation known as Open Access. The paper undertakes an analysis of scientific publication in Latin America and the Caribbean. We conclude from this analysis that scientific production in this area is underrepresented in databases such as Journal Citation Report (JCR) and Scientific Journal Ranking (SJR). Following this analysis we reassess the presence of Latin American social science in other databases such as SciELO and Redalyc. We do so using Agamben's category of dipositif alongside that of coloniality of knowledge. These two theoretical elements contribute to the political meaning of Open Access in Latin America and the Caribbean. Open Access thus constitutes a political move towards decolonization and the reappropriation of knowledge, allowing the return of publicly-funded research.",a=openaccess,m=biblio; m=document review,d=socscie,t=researcher,geo=SA,"researcher=scientific producers?

Methods This study included consecutive original articles published online in European Radiology. Pearson chi(2), Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess for any differences between open access and subscription access articles. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association between open access publishing and citation rate, adjusted for continent of origin, subspeciality, study findings in article title, number of authors, number of references, length of the article, and number of days the article has been online. In a secondary analysis, we determined the association between open access and number of downloads and shares. Results A total of 500 original studies, of which 86 (17.2%) were open access and 414 (82.8%) were subscription access articles, were included. Articles from Europe or North America were significantly more frequently published open access (p = 0.024 and p = 0.001), while articles with corresponding authors from Asia were significantly less frequently published open access (p < 0.001). In adjusted linear regression analysis, open access articles were significantly more frequently cited (beta coefficient = 3.588, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.668 to 6.508, p = 0.016), downloaded (beta coefficient = 759.801, 95% CI 630.917 to 888.685, p < 0.001), and shared (beta coefficient = 0.748, 95% CI 0.124 to 1.372, p = 0.019) than subscription access articles (beta coefficient = 3.94, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 6.44, p = 0.002).

Faculty expectations for this course are that students will conduct literature searches and use articles that are empirical studies from peer-reviewed journals, published within the previous ten years. Reference lists of 382 students were collected between 2005 and 2013, and reviewed for inclusion of articles from open access journals. Of 594 unique journal titles, 68 (11.45 percent) were available under various open access conditions. Findings suggest that graduate students are using both library collections and Web crawlers to satisfy literature search assignments when not directed to specific portals.

Inquiry into differences among open access sources referenced between 2005 and 2014 revealed that non-indexed journals were being used notably fewer times than their commercially indexed counterparts. A comparison of HTML source code between indexed and non-indexed journals illustrated that certain metadata and other coding features may have affected the visibility of non-indexed journal content. The study suggests to librarians the presence of less visible empirical literature on the web and to smaller, independent academic publishers, the need to apply better quality metadata and optimization strategies to their open access journal content.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,d=none,geo=USA,n=392 reference lists of graduate  students,,"Allen, Ethan J.; Weber, Roberta K.",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF WEB LIBRARIANSHIP,English,Article,,,,,"[Allen, Ethan J.] Florida Atlantic Univ Lib, John D MacArthur Campus Lib, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Weber, Roberta K.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Curriculum Culture & Educ Inquiry, Jupiter, FL USA",,28,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",1932-2909,,2015,9,2-3,65,84,10.1080/19322909.2015.1020185,,,WOS:000213902700003,,2021-01-27

We explore a new method for answering this question by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected communities with limited diffusion to the public.

Sharing data potentially contributes the largest, most efficient source of scientific data, but is fraught with contextual challenges which make stakeholders, particularly those in under-resourced contexts hesitant or slow to share. Relatively little empirical research has engaged stakeholders in discussing the issue. This study sought to explore relevant experiences, contextual, and subjective explanations around the topic to provide a rich and detailed presentation of what it means to different stakeholders and contexts to share data and how that can guide practice and ethical guidance. A qualitative design involving interviews was undertaken with professionals working in public health institutions endowed with data (HDSS), ethics committees, and advisory agencies which help shape health research in Africa. A descriptive form of thematic analysis was used to summarize results into six key themes: (1) The role of HDSSs in research using public health data and data-sharing; (2) Ownership and funding are critical factors influencing data-sharing; (3) Other factors discourage data-sharing; (4) Promoting and sustaining data-sharing; (5) Ethical guidance structures; and (6) Establishing effective guidance. The themes reveal factors regarding the willingness or not to share and an intricate ethical system that current discourse could reflect. Many of the concerns resonate with the literature, but a whole other gamut of people and process issues; commitments, investments, careers, and the right ethical guidance are needed to realize a sustainable goal of reaching 'share' as a default.",a=opendata,m=interview,d=med,t=researcher; t=policy; t=other,geo=GHA; geo=TZA,,,"Anane-Sarpong, Evelyn; Wangmo, Tenzin; Ward, Claire Leonie; Sankoh, Osman; Tanner, Marcel; Elger, Bernice Simone",,,,J,,DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Anane-Sarpong, Evelyn] Univ Basel, Inst Biomed Eth IBMB, Publ Hlth Eth, Basel, Switzerland; [Anane-Sarpong, Evelyn] Univ Basel, Collaborat Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Wangmo, Tenzin; Elger, Bernice Simone] IBMB, Basel, Switzerland; [Ward, Claire Leonie] IBMB, Hlth Eth, Basel, Switzerland; [Sankoh, Osman] INDEPTH Network, Accra, Ghana; [Tanner, Marcel] Univ Basel, Epidemiol & Med Parasitol, Basel, Switzerland; [Tanner, Marcel] Univ Basel, Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland; [Elger, Bernice Simone] Univ Geneva, Ctr Legal Med, Geneva, Switzerland",,37,2,WILEY,1471-8731,,2018,18,4,394,405,10.1111/dewb.12159,,,WOS:000225786300015,28745008,2021-01-27

Survey research design was used for the study. The population of the study comprised of 5,365 lecturers in seven federal universities covering both conventional and specialized universities. Sample sizes of 359 lecturers were randomly selected for the study. A structured questionnaire was designed and used for the study. Out of the 359 copies of the questionnaire administered, 330 copies were returned and used for the study. Collected data were analysed using frequency counts, percentages, mean and standard deviation. Inferential statistical tool such as Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used. Four research questions were answered and two null hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that the level of use of open access journals by academic staff was fairly high (weighted mean score = 2.84); the extent of the effect of Internet services by academic staff is fairly adequate. A significant relationship was established between academic staff use of open access journals and each of the following: extent of staff competence (r= .75; df= 329; p < 0.05) and Internet services (r= .99; df= 329; p < 0.05). Based on the findings, it was recommended among others that, there should be constant training and retraining of computer and Internet use to lecturers in the studied universities, Management of universities in the North Central, Nigeria should install and improve their Internet services, procure and provide adequate information and communication technology (ICT) facilities that would serve the university communities effectively. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=NGA,"y perhaps 2015, non mentioned in article",,Ango A.A.,,,,,,Library Philosophy and Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,0,University of Idaho Library,15220222,0,2019,2019,0,0,0,,,,WOS:000230939700006,,2021-01-27

Data for the research were collected with a survey questionnaire using 50 university librarians in Nigeria through electronic mail and social media platforms. A follow up interview was used to elicit qualitative data from the university librarian. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were extracted to confirm and consolidate the data as collected. The results were presented as simple percentages, tables and charts. Nigerian universities are supporting the green and gold models of open access initiatives, though emphasis is more on the green model-the institutional repository majority of which were yet to be listed in the OpenDOAR. There was perceived high use of open access resources by faculty members in spite of very few who could not use the resources due to unawareness, lack of skill and institutional reservations on open access resources quality. Promotional strategies adopted include advocacy and infrastructural development with limited user survey initiatives. The ingenuity of the university library is important for Open Access Resources (OAR) promotion. Nigerian universities have made incursions into the support of OAR (www.nusoer.org) especially the green model which discovery and access are promoted through advocacy, infrastructural development and survey initiatives. Librarians and continuing professional development stakeholders could deploy the results to assess their status in OAR support and promotion. © 2018, Chinwe V.

Design: Mixed method, sequential exploratory design. Setting: A large, multi-campus New Zealand university that mandates IR deposit of doctoral theses. Subjects: Two doctoral students from each of four university colleges were interviewed. All 901 doctoral students were subsequently sent a survey, with 251 responding. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with eight subjects selected by purposive sampling, followed by a survey sent to all doctoral students. The authors used NVivo 8 for analysis of interview data, along with a twophase approach to coding. First, they analyzed transcripts from semi-structured interviews line-by-line to identify themes. In the second phase, authors employed focused coding to analyze the most common themes and to merge or drop peripheral themes. Themes were mapped against Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory and social exchange theory constructs to aid interpretation. The results were used to develop a survey with a fixed set of response choices. Authors then analyzed survey results using Excel and SurveyMonkey, first as a single data set and then by discipline. Main Results: The authors found that general awareness of open access was high (62%), and overall support for open access publication was 86.3%. Awareness of IRs as a general concept was much lower at 48%. Those subject to a mandatory IR deposit policy for doctoral theses overwhelmingly indicated willingness to comply (92.6%), as did those matriculating prior to the policy (83.3%), although only 77.3% of all respondents agreed that deposit should be mandatory. Only 17.6% of respondents had deposited their own work in an IR, while 31.7% reported directly accessing a repository for research. The greatest perceived benefits of IR participation were removal of cost for readers, ease of sharing research, increased exposure and citing of one's work, and professional networking. The greatest perceived risks were plagiarism, loss of ability to publish elsewhere, and less prestige relative to traditional publication. The reason most given for selecting a specific publication outlet was recommendation of a doctoral supervisor. Disciplinary differences in responses were not sizable.For additional interpretation, the authors applied Rogers's diffusion of innovations theory to determine the extent to which IRs are effective innovations. The authors posit that repositories will become a more widely adopted innovations as awareness of IRs in general increases, and through increased awareness that IR content is discoverable through major search engines such as Google Scholar, thus improving usability and increasing dissemination of research. Using the social exchange theory framework, the authors found that respondents' expressed willingness to deposit their work in IRs demonstrated altruistic motives for sharing their research freely with others, appreciation for the reciprocity of gaining access to others' research, and awareness of the potential direct reward of having their work cited more often. Conclusion: Authors identified that lack of awareness, rather than resistance to deposit, as the main barrier to IR depository participation. Major benefits perceived for participating included the public good of knowledge sharing and increased exposure for one's work. Concerns included copyright and plagiarism issues. These findings have implications for communication and marketing campaigns to promote doctoral students' deposit of their work in institutional repositories. While respondents reported low direct use of IRs for conducting research, the vast majority reported using Google Scholar, and so may have unknowingly accessed open access repository content. This finding suggests that attention be given to enhanced metadata for optimizing discoverability of IR content through genera search engines. © 2012 Arndt.",a=openaccess,m=interview; m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=university; t=researcher,geo=NZL,n = added survey and interview respondents; no year of study mentioned,,Arndt T.S.,,,,,,Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,University of Alberta,1715720X,0,2012,7,4,119,121,10.18438/b8qw4r,,,WOS:000243687300019,,2021-01-27

This study simultaneously estimates the article processing charges for 535 open access journals independently launched by publishers along with citation scores and number of articles in a journal to identify the determinants of charges. The results show that open access journal publishers set higher article processing charges for more frequently cited journals with more articles. However, concentration measured by the share squared of the number of articles in an academic field is not shown to influence the charges significantly. Moreover, this study finds that large subscription journal publishers do not generally set higher article processing charges for their open access journals. Instead, they incorporate open access journal publishers that have already accomplished great achievements into their company groups.

This study empirically examines the effect of collaborating with large publishers on the internationality and influence of research institutions' journals. The study compiles 60 Scopus-indexed open access journals and finds their citation frequency through the SCImago journal rank and source normalized impact per publication. Furthermore, it uses the country distribution of authors and citations to determine the journals' internationality. The results revealed that most journals increased the number of articles written by overseas researchers and their citation scores, which indicates that collaborating with large publishers is an effective method for enhancing the internationality and influence of institutions' official journals in non-English-speaking countries in particular. However, in addition to publishing journals on publishers' websites, research institutions' efforts toward internationality, such as appointing overseas researchers as editors, are essential to accomplish the desired outcome.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=publisher; t=university,geo=nonspecific,t=universities - include academic societies and other research institutions to this category,,"Asai, Sumiko",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Asai, Sumiko] Meiji Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-1 Kanda Surugadai, Tokyo 1018301, Japan",,31,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,124,1,663,677,10.1007/s11192-020-03426-4,,,WOS:000247624500004,,2021-01-27

In fact, the researcher has used of citation analysis technique of bibliometric and large-scale sociometric analyses on about 16,219 citations. The method followed in the first part of this study is obtaining data from e-journal articles which indexed in TSMJL, conducting descriptive analyses, and reporting the findings in tables and figures. In the second part of the study, DOAJ database is used to behaviour cited reference searches and other citation analyses. It found that there are 960 Iranian print-based journals and only 37 Iranian Journals was indexed in TSMJL. Sixteen English Journals in TSMJL of eight Iranian universities. Throughout sixteen journals only one journal didn't publish during 2007 and there were 704 articles all over the fifteen journals.

This disadvantages researchers in the global south, policy makers and practitioners who have the skills to use research findings but do not have journal subscriptions. Open access seeks to increase availability of research, but take-up among criminologists has been low. This study used a sample of 12,541 articles published in criminology journals between 2017 and 2019 to estimate the proportion of articles available via different types of open access. Overall 22% of research was available to non-subscribers, about half that found in other disciplines, even though authors had the right to make articles open without payment in at least 95% of cases. Open access was even less common in many leading journals and among researchers in the United States.

The potentials of citation analytics may be exploited to understand the gains of publishing scholarly peer-reviewed research outputs in either Open Access (OA) sources or Subscription-Based (SB) sources in the bid to increase citation impact. However, relevant data required for such comparative analysis must be freely accessible for evidence-based findings and conclusions. In this data article, citation scores (CiteScores) of 2542 OA sources and 15,040 SB sources indexed in Scopus from 2014 to 2016 were presented and analyzed based on a set of five inclusion criteria. A robust dataset, which contains the CiteScores of OA and SB publication sources included, is attached as supplementary material to this data article to facilitate further reuse. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of OA CiteScores and SB CiteScores are presented in tables. Boxplot representations and scatter plots are provided to show the statistical distributions of OA CiteScores and SB CiteScores across the three sub -categories (Book Series, Journal, and Trade Journal). Correlation coefficient and p-value matrices are made available within the data article. In addition, Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of OA CiteScores and SB CiteScores are computed and the results are presented using tables and graphs. Furthermore, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison post-hoc tests are conducted to understand the statistical difference (and its significance, if any) in the citation impact of OA publication sources and SB publication source based on CiteScore. In the long run, the data provided in this article will help policy makers and researchers in Higher Education Institutions (HEls) to identify the appropriate publication source type and category for dissemination of scholarly research findings with maximum citation impact.

These datasets can be used by educators as Open Educational Resources (OER) to support different teaching and learning activities, allowing students to gain experience working with the same raw data researchers and policy-makers generate and use. In this way, educators can facilitate students to understand how information is generated, processed, analysed and interpreted. This paper offers an initial exploration of ways in which the use of Open Data can be key in the development of transversal skills (including digital and data literacies, alongside skills for critical thinking, research, teamwork, and global citizenship), enhancing students' abilities to understand and select information sources, to work with, curate, analyse and interpret data, and to conduct and evaluate research. This paper also presents results of an exploratory survey that can guide further research into Open Data-led learning activities.

A descriptive survey design was used in the study and the study population was comprised of 7,423 master's degree students in the University of Ibadan and 1,867 from Obafemi Awolowo University. A multistage random sampling technique was used to select a sample size of 249 and the data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, mean, standard deviation, correlation, and regression analyses. The findings revealed that OAJs were used for learning, dissertation writing, personal research, and development. OAJs were not frequently used because of download delays, unavailability of Internet facilities, and limited access to computers terminals, among other issues. OAJs were found to be of relative advantage, positively perceived, and found to be compatible with existing values and quality assurance in scholarly publications, hence their use for academic activities. The regression analyses showed that there was a significant positive relationship between positive perception, perception of relative advantage, perception of compatibility, perception complexity, and master's degree students' use of OAJs. Negative perception was found to have a significant negative correlation with the use of OAJs. This article recommends that quality assurance of OAJs should be ensured in order to boost users' positive perceptions to increase their patronage and usage of these scholarly outlets for various academic activities, which will in turn encourage research and development across the various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria. © Philips Oluwaseun Ayeni, 2017.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=natscie; d=soscie; d=hum,t=other,geo=NGA,y=year of Master student semester,,Ayeni P.O.,,,,,,Journal of Information Science Theory and Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information,22879099,0,2017,5,1,26,46,10.1633/JISTaP.2017.5.1.3,,,WOS:000258356100007,,2021-01-27

While librarians have written numerous reviews of these products, no one has yet conducted a usability study on these tools. This article details a usability study involving six undergraduate students and six faculty at a large public research university in the United States. Participants were tasked with installing each of the four tools as well as trying them out on three test articles. Both students and faculty tended to favor simple, clean design elements and straightforward functionality that enabled them to use the tools with limited instruction.

In order to try to address this situation, the UK Scholarly Communication Licence (UK-SCL) was formulated to bypass the root causes of many of these challenges by implementing a licensing mechanism for multiple-mandate compliance in one single policy. This is the first empirical study to focus on the genesis of the UK-SCL and how its implementation has been conceived thus far. A qualitative research method was used, taking the form of 14 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from the initiative across the UK. The results indicate that those working within UK HEIs are concerned with the complexity of the current OA policy landscape and are frustrated with the inertia within the current system, which has resulted in higher costs, further publisher restrictions, and has not addressed the underlying tensions in academic culture. The UK-SCL is seen by its initiators as a way to achieve further transition towards OA and take back some element of control of the content produced at their institutions.

The study also revealed that when considering where to publish, reputation and impact factor of journal were rated as very important among the factors that inform their choice of OA. The study further revealed that academic librarians have little or no knowledge about the existence of institutional repositories in their institutions, and only a few actual use institutional repositories and Research Gate to self-archive their publications. The majority of the academic librarians agreed that author fees (Article Processing Charges) and low impact factor of journal are barriers to publishing in OA journals. Training on OA publishing is recommended for librarians to increase their knowledge and confidence to discuss OA with faculty members in future.

Results and methodological reflections of an application of multiple measures to an analysis by WoS subject areas,Citation analysis; Open access citation advantage; Open access journals; Web of Science; Normalised citation scores; Open access,"This study is one of the first that uses the recently introduced open access (OA) labels in the Web of Science (WoS) metadata to investigate whether OA articles published in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listed journals experience a citation advantage in comparison to subscription journal articles, specifically those of which no self-archived versions are available. Bibliometric data on all articles and reviews indexed in WoS, and published from 2013 to 2015, were analysed. In addition to normalised citation score (NCS), we used two additional measures of citation advantage: whether an article was cited at all; and whether an article is among the most frequently cited percentile of articles within its respective subject area (pptopX %). For each WoS subject area, the strength of the relationship between access status (whether an article was published in an OA journal) and each of these three measures was calculated. We found that OA journal articles experience a citation advantage in very few subject areas and, in most of these subject areas, the citation advantage was found on only a single measure of citation advantage, namely whether the article was cited at all. Our results lead us to conclude that access status accounts for little of the variability in the number of citations an article accumulates. The methodology and the calculations that were used in this study are described in detail and we believe that the lessons we learnt, and the recommendations we make, will be of much use to future researchers interested in using the WoS OA labels, and to the field of citation advantage in general.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,n=journal articles (research and review); only English,,"Basson, Isabel; Blanckenberg, Jaco P.; Prozesky, Heidi",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,"[Basson, Isabel; Blanckenberg, Jaco P.; Prozesky, Heidi] Stellenbosch Univ, DST NRF Ctr Excellence Scientometr & STI Policy, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Basson, Isabel; Blanckenberg, Jaco P.; Prozesky, Heidi] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Res Sci & Technol CREST, Stellenbosch, South Africa",,40,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,,,,,,10.1007/s11192-020-03734-9,,,WOS:000285692100004,,2021-01-27

A review is given of the literature, with an emphasis on studies dealing with flipping journals. Two study sets with 119 and 100 flipping journals, derived from two different OA data sources (DOAJ and OAD), are compared with two control groups, one based on a standard bibliometric criterion, and a second controlling for a journal's national orientation. Comparing post-switch indicators with pre-switch ones in paired T-tests, evidence was obtained of an OACitationadvantage butnotof an OAPublicationAdvantage. Shifts in the affiliation countries of publishing and citing authors are characterized in terms of countries' income class and geographical world region.

However, countries and institutions are not in the same context about resources to build an open path for research production. For this reason, Open Access and Science are strategies of relevance that enable collaboration among researchers around the world and institutional areas. We do a systematic review with the aim of exploring the potentials, and limitations of Open Science (OS) and Open Access (OA) to scientific collaboration and production. We did an initial screening of an abstract of 1664 publications in Scopus to select 144 documents related. Finally, a detailed review of the articles presents 17 documents that deal specifically with the functionalities and barriers of OS and OA. The given arguments highlight the efficiency, and abilities to democratize the production of knowledge and to generate ideas and innovative solutions to current problems. Likewise, this article addresses the barriers found in the academic level. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the arguments treated by scientists in the dispute over whether to use it or not. Specifically, our objectives are to: (a) analyze the role of open science and open access in scientific production, (b) identify the barriers that authors experiment when opting for open access and open science. At last, we discuss the potential of OS to overcome the territorial, economic, and infrastructure barriers that certain researchers may experience in their production of scientific research collaboratively and equitably.

However, many potential providers are still hesitant to open their datasets and at the same time users often face difficulties when attempting to use this data in practice. This indicates that there are still various barriers present both regarding usage and publishing of Open Data, but studies that systematically collect and assess these barriers regarding their impact are rare. Based on this observation we survey prior literature on barriers, and have developed a questionnaire aimed at both assessing the users and publishers views on obstacles regarding Open Data adoption. Using a sample of over 100 participants from Austria who completed our online survey, we draw conclusions about the relative importance of the barriers reported in the literature.

By removing barriers to online data and encouraging publication in Open Access formats and Open Data archives, OS seeks to expand the role, reach and value of research.

Of those adopting OA models, the majority seek to cover costs through author-side charges in the region of US$ 1,000-3,000. Optional or 'hybrid' OA models are increasingly commonplace, although most are experiencing uptake of below 10%, with some notable exceptions. Early evidence from these initiatives suggests that OA leads to an increase in online usage. Meanwhile numerous fully OA journals have launched, and a few subscription journals have made the transition to full OA. Several case studies indicate that fully OA models reliant upon author-side charges are viable, depending on authors being able and willing to pay publication charges, and other influential factors including rejection rate. Most authors continue to rank other considerations, including speed of publication, quality of peer review, and impact factor, as more important than a journal's OA policies, although funder and university-level mandates seem likely to have an increasing influence on an author's choice of where to publish.

282,WOS,stefan_skupien,A Study of Innovative Features in Scholarly Open Access Journals,Scholarly publishing; open access; Internet; peer review,"Background: The emergence of the Internet has triggered tremendous changes in the publication of scientific peer-reviewed journals. Today, journals are usually available in parallel electronic versions, but the way the peer-review process works, the look of articles and journals, and the rigid and slow publication schedules have remained largely unchanged, at least for the vast majority of subscription-based journals. Those publishing firms and scholarly publishers who have chosen the more radical option of open access (OA), in which the content of journals is freely accessible to anybody with Internet connectivity, have had a much bigger degree of freedom to experiment with innovations. Objective: The objective was to study how open access journals have experimented with innovations concerning ways of organizing the peer review, the format of journals and articles, new interactive and media formats, and novel publishing revenue models. Methods: The features of 24 open access journals were studied. The journals were chosen in a nonrandom manner from the approximately 7000 existing OA journals based on available information about interesting journals and include both representative cases and highly innovative outlier cases. Results: Most early OA journals in the 1990s were founded by individual scholars and used a business model based on voluntary work close in spirit to open-source development of software. In the next wave, many long-established journals, in particular society journals and journals from regions such as Latin America, made their articles OA when they started publishing parallel electronic versions. From about 2002 on, newly founded professional OA publishing firms using article-processing charges to fund their operations have emerged. Over the years, there have been several experiments with new forms of peer review, media enhancements, and the inclusion of structured data sets with articles. In recent years, the growth of OA publishing has also been facilitated by the availability of open-source software for journal publishing. Conclusions: The case studies illustrate how a new technology and a business model enabled by new technology can be harnessed to find new innovative ways for the organization and content of scholarly publishing.

This study looks closer at the current publishing situation in construction management and related fields and compares empirical data about 17 OA journals and 16 traditional subscription journals. Of the articles published in 2011 in the subscription journals only 9 % could be found as OA copies. The overall OA availability (including articles in OA journals) was 14 % for Construction Management and Economics and 29 % for construction IT scholarship.

The journal has, after some initial struggle, survived its first decade and is now established as one of half-a-dozen peer reviewed journals in its field. Operations The journal publishes articles as they become ready, but creates virtual issues through alerting messages to ""subscribers"". It has also started to publish special issues, since this helps in attracting submissions, and also helps in sharing the work-load of review management. From the start the journal adopted a rather traditional layout of the articles. After the first few years the HTML version was dropped and papers are only published in PDF format. Performance The journal has recently been benchmarked against the competing journals in its field. Its acceptance rate of 53% is slightly higher and its average turnaround time of seven months almost a year faster compared to those journals in the sample for which data could be obtained.

Such journals pretend to use peer review for quality assurance, and spam academics with requests for submissions, in order to collect author payments. In recent years predatory journals have received a lot of negative media. While much has been said about the harm that such journals cause to academic publishing in general, an overlooked aspect is how much articles in such journals are actually read and in particular cited, that is if they have any significant impact on the research in their fields. Other studies have already demonstrated that only some of the articles in predatory journals contain faulty and directly harmful results, while a lot of the articles present mediocre and poorly reported studies. We studied citation statistics over a five-year period in Google Scholar for 250 random articles published in such journals in 2014 and found an average of 2.6 citations per article, and that 56% of the articles had no citations at all. For comparison, a random sample of articles published in the approximately 25,000 peer reviewed journals included in the Scopus index had an average of 18, 1 citations in the same period with only 9% receiving no citations.

293,WOS,stefan_skupien,A longitudinal study of independent scholar-published open access journals,Open access; Scientific publishing,"Open Access (OA) is nowadays increasingly being used as a business model for the publishing of scholarly peer reviewed journals, both by specialized OA publishing companies and major, predominantly subscription-based publishers. However, in the early days of the web OA journals were mainly founded by independent academics, who were dissatisfied with the predominant print and subscription paradigm and wanted to test the opportunities offered by the new medium. There is still an on-going debate about how OA journals should be operated, and the volunteer model used by many such 'indie' journals has been proposed as a viable alternative to the model adopted by big professional publishers where publishing activities are funded by authors paying expensive article processing charges (APCs). Our longitudinal quantitative study of 250 'indie' OA journals founded prior to 2002, showed that 51% of these journals were still in operation in 2014 and that the median number of articles published per year had risen from 11 to 18 among the survivors. Of these surviving journals, only 8% had started collecting APCs.

294,WOS,stefan_skupien,Open access versus subscription journals: a comparison of scientific impact,impact; open access; peer review; scientific publishing,"Background: In the past few years there has been an ongoing debate as to whether the proliferation of open access (OA) publishing would damage the peer review system and put the quality of scientific journal publishing at risk. Our aim was to inform this debate by comparing the scientific impact of OA journals with subscription journals, controlling for journal age, the country of the publisher, discipline and (for OA publishers) their business model. Methods: The 2-year impact factors (the average number of citations to the articles in a journal) were used as a proxy for scientific impact. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) was used to identify OA journals as well as their business model. Journal age and discipline were obtained from the Ulrich's periodicals directory. Comparisons were performed on the journal level as well as on the article level where the results were weighted by the number of articles published in a journal. A total of 610 OA journals were compared with 7,609 subscription journals using Web of Science citation data while an overlapping set of 1,327 OA journals were compared with 11,124 subscription journals using Scopus data. Results: Overall, average citation rates, both unweighted and weighted for the number of articles per journal, were about 30% higher for subscription journals. However, after controlling for discipline (medicine and health versus other), age of the journal (three time periods) and the location of the publisher (four largest publishing countries versus other countries) the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories except for journals that had been launched prior to 1996. OA journals that fund publishing with article processing charges (APCs) are on average cited more than other OA journals. In medicine and health, OA journals founded in the last 10 years are receiving about as many citations as subscription journals launched during the same period. Conclusions: Our results indicate that OA journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,y=2010 = date of catalogue version from which  journals where selected ,,"Bjork, Bo-Christer; Solomon, David",,,,J,,BMC MEDICINE,English,Article,,,,,"[Bjork, Bo-Christer] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Solomon, David] Michigan State Univ, Coll Human Med, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,19,126,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,1741-7015,,2012,10,,,,,,,WOS:000312164800001,22805105,2021-01-27

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the perceptions and reactions of academic librarians in Nigerian private universities to OA publishing as a medium for disseminating quality scientific knowledge and for assessing the contributions of scholars to global knowledge improvements. Ten of the seventeen private universities in Southwestern Nigeria were randomly selected, and 42 academic librarians from the ten universities were surveyed. A questionnaire adapted from Palmer, et al. (2009) was used to collect data. The findings showed that academic librarians in Nigerian private universities have positive perception of OA scholarly publishing.

The question is whether the responsible actors and if the universities are ready to implement the change. The significance of open access has amplified in Sweden. Earlier research has brought to light that the collection and preservation of research data are often surrounded by ambiguous rules and lack a comprehensive structure. For example, archiving is not given enough consideration in connection to research projects and researchers often tend to save their material on platforms that are not persistent over time. This article is based upon a qualitative research approach where 15 semi-structured interviews have been used as primarily data sources to investigate the implementation of open access of research data and scientific publications. The article investigated how Swedish universities and public authorities were working with archiving and implementation of open research data and their opinions on open access. The results displayed a lack of coordination, resources and infrastructure but also that common agreed nomenclature were missing. The management of research data was not part of an overall recordkeeping strategy. One explanation could be differences in the information culture among researchers and archivists.

Design/methodology/approach - Online questionnaire was designed to collect data from 402 academic librarians in 87 universities in Africa using SurveyMonkey software. Findings - The study found that academic librarians are aware of the green and gold routes but not familiar with the diamond route. The study revealed that a large number of the academic librarians have published only one paper in OA journals, followed by those who have not published any paper in OA journals. The study also revealed that reputation of journal and impact factor of journal were seen as very important among the factors that inform them of choosing OA. The majority of the respondents agreed that author fees, and lack of stable internet connectivity are the major barriers to publishing in OA journals. Practical implications - The study recommends that academic libraries in institutions of higher learning in Africa should organize seminars periodically on the need for their librarians to research and publish in OA journals. Social implications - Identifying factors involved in author decisions to publish in OA journals will help illuminate issues that may encourage or discourage author support of OA publishing models.

As the data shows, there is a tremendous variance of article processing charges (APC) across journals, which obviously cannot be explained by the costs. One of the explanatory variables could be reputation, but it only contributes less than 5% to the variance in average APC. This study is meant to shed light on the various determinants of APC. Based on the data from the OpenAPC Initiative, the Directory of Open Access Journals and three different datasets of Web of Science, we employ ANOVAs and multivariate regressions. The results show that market power plays an important role to explain APC, inter alia, through market concentration, market position of individual publishers (publisher size), and the choice of hybrid publishing model.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Budzinski, Oliver; Grebel, Thomas; Wolling, Jens; Zhang, Xijie",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Budzinski, Oliver; Grebel, Thomas; Zhang, Xijie] Technol Univ Ilmenau, Inst Econ, Ilmenau, Germany; [Wolling, Jens] Technol Univ Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, Ilmenau, Germany",,65,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,124,3,2185,2206,10.1007/s11192-020-03578-3,,,WOS:000330622600015,,2021-01-27

We compared the number of citations of OA and non-OA papers in six journals and four books published since 2000 to test whether OA increases number of citations overall and increases citations made by authors in developing countries. After controlling for type of paper (e. g., review or research paper), length of paper, authors' citation profiles, number of authors per paper, and whether the author or the publisher released the paper in OA, OA had no statistically significant influence on the overall number of citations per journal paper. Journal papers were cited more frequently if the authors had published highly cited papers previously, were members of large teams of authors, or published relatively long papers, but papers were not cited more frequently if they were published in an OA source. Nevertheless, author-archived OA book chapters accrued up to eight times more citations than chapters in the same book that were not available through OA, perhaps because there is no online abstracting service for book chapters. There was also little evidence that journal papers or book chapters published in OA received more citations from authors in developing countries relative to those journal papers or book chapters not published in OA. For scholarly publications in conservation biology, only book chapters had an OA citation advantage, and OA did not increase the number of citations papers or chapters received from authors in developing countries.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=natscie,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Calver, Michael C.; Bradley, J.

This study seeks to understand the range of funding sources that are available and used by faculties in these disciplines to pay for APCs associated with publishing in open access journals, as well as attitudes towards and awareness of available institutional funds that may inflect future engagement with open access publishing. The authors distributed a survey to faculty who had an open access journal article published in 2017 from three doctoral granting, high research activity universities in the United States. Twenty-two scholars participated in the final survey, ten of whom indicated that they paid an APC for their publication. While the results cannot make generalizations about funding sources, they do suggest that both the prevalence of APCs as well as attitudes about open access engagement may be influenced by disciplinary self-identification.

This study is based on the analysis of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) research publication data within four broad disciplines - health science, life science, physical science and social science - and the purpose of this paper is to understand the perspectives and preferences of academic researchers around OA. The findings are useful to libraries in shaping their strategies for meeting the rising challenges of scholarly publishing. Design/methodology/approach - Article publication data from HKU have been collected and analyzed with the purpose of exploring general OA trends and understanding authors' incentives for publishing in OA journals. Findings - The explosion in the number of OA journals in recent years has not only impacted on how libraries manage contents and budgets, but also on academic researchers' choice of journals for submitting their articles for publication. This study conducted at the HKU indicated that academic researchers have a gradual tendency to shift toward publishing their work in OA journals, and interestingly, the shifts are to some extent discipline specific. Research limitations/implications - The OA marketplace is currently undergoing a state of flux. The OA model of funding through article publication charges, process of peer review and reputation in the marketplace are under rapid development. Practical implications - As OA journals take up a sizeable market share of the scholarly journal publishing market, libraries need to stay abreast of developments in the OA sector in order to respond to researcher needs. Understanding the thinking behind researcher's decisions in choosing venue for submission of publications helps to advance research support services which the library offers. Social implications - The change in researcher behavior prompted by the gravitation toward sharing of research contents in scholarly communication networks and broader choice of OA journals have resulted in a positive growth of OA articles publishing at the HKU. Originality/value - This study is based on actual HKU publication data in the past ten years, and it is useful for understanding HKU researchers' attitudes toward OA publications and in particular the longitudinal trends in shifting toward OA publishing within the context of the university's open policy and within the global OA landscape.",a=openaccess,m=biblio; ,d=med; d=natscie; d=soscie,t=university; t=librarian,geo=HKG,not accessible; correction StS: found article online; adds d=interdisciplinary,,"Chan, Gayle Rosemary; Cheung, Allan Shi-Chung",,,,J,,LIBRARY MANAGEMENT,English,Article,,,,,"[Chan, Gayle Rosemary] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Libraries, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheung, Allan Shi-Chung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,18,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,0143-5124,,2017,38,8-9,488,496,10.1108/LM-02-2017-0013,,,WOS:000347363800022,,2021-01-27

Of 19 LIS OA journals and 1819 research articles published between 2008 and 2013, half of the authors (55.6%) worked in libraries and approximately one third were researchers (33.5%). No appreciable changes were observed in the annual distributions of authors' occupations. Regarding the types of collaboration, 53.7% of all articles were coauthored and primarily resulted from collaborations among librarians. The coauthored articles written by librarians and researchers accounted for the second-most prevalent type of collaboration; the highest increase was identified in the annual percentage of articles resulting from collaboration between librarians and researchers. This confirms that librarians engage in increasingly frequent interaction with researchers.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on the development of IRs in Greece and discusses their content and the various access restrictions that apply to content. A questionnaire survey was used to identify current and future steps regarding open access from the IR managers' and library directors' perspective. Findings: The paper finds that Greek IRs using DSpace and CDS Invenio software have been developed by libraries of academic institutions. The Berlin Declaration on open access has been signed by two academic institutions and one research institution, while another university will bring the matter to the Senate. Metadata harvesting is one point that all respondents agreed on, although it seems that a national harvesting service will not be established in the near future. Furthermore, content availability at the moment seems to be hindered by fear of copyright infringement rather than financial charges, at least for ETDs. Research limitations/implications: Further research should be conducted in order to identify the rate of deposited published peer-reviewed research in IRs. Furthermore, a broader survey could show the thoughts and future plans of the total of Greek IRs, not just those using OAI-PMH or those with mixed content (gray literature and published research). Possible research topics could be the interoperability of IRs in order to build a national harvesting service and the access restrictions that are available for authors in each IR.

Design/methodology/approach - The study selected 86 source journals of LIS in the SSCI as a sample and measured their status of open access. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to analyze 36 OA journals of 86 source journals, especially their production capability, academic influence and network communication ability. Findings - The results indicate that OA journals have become an increasingly important part of LIS journals. Production capability, academic influence and network communication ability are important factors affecting the quality of OA journals. These three evaluation indicators of LIS OA journals are high, but many still have room for improvement. Research limitations/implications - As the paper is limited by collecting data, the indicators of OA journals' quality are not all-around. So, they cannot reflect the quality of LIS OA journals. In the selection of the evaluation method, the evaluation results are limited because only one AHP method is used. Practical implications - The research on evaluation of OA journals can help library and scientific research personnel use OA journals effectively. Identifying key factors on evaluation can help researchers to construct OA journals better. Social implications - The research on OA journals' quality can also promote the study on OA process in academic circles and promote the communication, development and utilization of academic information. Such research can also enrich the theory of OA, and provide some new perspectives for the study of journals' evaluation. Originality/value - This paper measures the quality of LIS OA journals by analyzing production capability, academic influence and network communication ability. Rather than the traditional research methods, the focus of this study is on the value of the Web as a source of impact indices.

Indeed, consensus regarding the necessity of open access initiatives in Greece is gradually established. The present of open access in other European settings may however be revealing the expected, though distinct, future of open access in Greece. This work focuses upon some current aspects for open access and attempts to investigate them for the Greek setting. The investigation includes five (5) important aspects of open access, i.e. a) ETDs management from the academic libraries, b) university repositories development, c) regulation of digital and/or printed scientific material quality requirements, d) cooperation and competition between libraries and academic publishers, e) understanding the role of scientific work dissemination in developing future professionals and scholars. The paper initially provides an outline for the Greek publishing industry, focusing on STM publishers and on the way they take advantage of the changes mainly in editorial and marketing terms, in a hybrid technological era. The Greek publishing industry may berepresentative of other national small publishing markets. Further, an empirical research is providing in order to illuminate open access from two different points of view: that of STM publishers and that of academic libraries' directors in Greece. The empirical investigation took place in February and March of 2007 and is based on seventeen experts' perceptions. The methods employed are outlined and include the development of the questionnaire for semi-structured interviews. Finally, the unexpected agreement from both publishers and academic libraries' directors regarding open access development is discussed and some specific for Greece conclusions are drawn.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=librarian; t=publisher,geo=GRC,,,"Christina B.G., Petros K.A.",,,,,,"Openness in Digital Publishing: Awareness, Discovery and Access - Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, ELPUB 2007",English,Conference Paper,"11th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, ELPUB 2007",13 June 2007 through 15 June 2007,Vienna,,,,,6,0,0,9783854372929,2007,0,0,229,237,,,,WOS:000359502000010,,2021-01-27

Prospective authors, especially trainees, may be unaware of predatory online journals or how to differentiate them from legitimate journals. In this study, we assessed awareness of open-access and predatory journals among prospective authors attending scientific writing workshops; our long-term goal was to inform educational goals for the workshops. We surveyed participants of writing workshops at veterinary and medical schools and an international conference over a 1-year period. The survey included 14 statements for respondents to indicate agreement level on a Likert-like scale and four questions on awareness of resources about predatory journals; respondents also defined predatory journal. A total of 145 participants completed the survey: 106 (73.1%) from veterinary schools and 86 (59.3%) graduate students or residents. Fewer faculty (vs trainees) agreed that open access was an important factor in deciding where to publish; faculty and postdoctoral researchers were more likely to expect to pay more to publish in an open-access journal. Most respondents (120/145, 82.7%) agreed/strongly agreed that the decision to accept a manuscript should not be influenced by publication charges, but 50% (56/112) indicated that they didn't know how publishing costs were supported. Of the 142 respondents who answered, 33 (23.0%) indicated awareness of the term predatory journal; 34 (23.9%) were aware of the Directory of Open Access Journals; 24 (16.9%) were aware of the Science sting article about predatory journals; and 7 (4.8%) were aware of Beall's list. Most (93/144, 64.5%) definitions of predatory journals described poor but not predatory journal practices, and some respondents misunderstood the term completely. Mentors should help novice authors to be aware of predatory journals and to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate open-access journals, thus selecting the best journal for their work.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=agric,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Christopher, Mary M.; Young, Karen M.",,,,J,,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Christopher, Mary M.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Young, Karen M.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,13,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,2015,2,,,,10.3389/fvets.2015.00022,,,WOS:000359509100009,26664951,2021-01-27
497,WOS,ronny_roewert,We should not light an open access lamp and then hide it under a bushel!,Discovery services; E-Journal supply chain; E-Publishing platforms; Hybrid journals; Interoperability and integration; Metadata standards; Open Access articles; RSS; Web feeds,"The rapid growth of hybrid journals in the last few years has seen an unfortunate side effect: the majority of Open Access (OA) articles published in those journals cannot be recognized as OA beyond the publishers' websites, or by the discovery services used by researchers to access full-text articles. This reality has been demonstrated in the literature and solutions have been proposed. This paper explains the causes behind the problem, examines each of the proposed solutions, discusses the few implementations made with those solutions, and estimates whether the potential benefits merit the efforts required to implement the available solutions. Each of the solutions is analyzed from standardization and pragmatic perspectives. In particular, we critically analyze the solution proposed by NISO (RP-22-2015), and compare it with the solution offered by the JEMO project, which is based on using metadata elements from namespaces and XML schemas already being used by publishers. The contribution presents a number of case studies which show that research published as OA ends up erroneously being labelled as non-OA on the electronic services used by the end-user, when one of the components of the supply and delivery chain for e-journals fails to include OA information in its metadata. Furthermore, the case studies demonstrate that publishers of hybrid journals should not be the only ones being answerable for the problem. In fact, during the study, some publishers were actually not allowed to enable OA identification, at the article level, by key components of the supply chain. In those case studies, we worked with a sample of publishers that implemented the JEMO solution. From those experiences we draw answers to the main question of this presentation: which solution should be used to enable OA discovery from hybrid journals? What becomes apparent is that publishers are prepared and willing to implement any of the available solutions in their publishing workflow. The paper proposes that the simplest option is the best solution to provide standardized means to identify OA at the article level. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Chumbe S., MacLeod R., Kelly B.",,,,,,"New Avenues for Electronic Publishing in the Age of Infinite Collections and Citizen Science: Scale, Openness and Trust - Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, Elpub 2015",English,Conference Paper,"19th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, Elpub 2015",1 September 2015 through 3 September 2015,0,,,,,1,IOS Press BV,0,9781614995616,2015,0,0,102,112,10.3233/978-1-61499-562-3-102,,,WOS:000360505300014,,2021-01-27

User support process is present in almost each and every e-Science infrastructure to support the users. However, there are fewer studies conducted that empirically evaluate the user support process in federated open data e-Science infrastructures and highlight major problems in the user support process.

This paper expounds a study conducted using interviews with the major stakeholders of ESGF. Based on the analysis of the interviews, a central problem in the current user support practices in ESGF is identified. In this paper, a solution to this central problem is recommended that can not only enhance the user support process in federated e-Science infrastructures like ESGF from the management perspective but also can improve the user experience and usability of federated e-Science and IT infrastructures.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=DEU; geo=USA; geo=AUS; geo=ESP,,,"Chunpir H.I., Zaina L.A.M.",,,,,,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference WWW/Internet 2016,English,Conference Paper,15th International Conference WWW/Internet 2016,28 October 2016 through 30 October 2016,0,,,,,3,IADIS,0,9789898533579,2016,0,0,27,34,,,,WOS:000360817500007,,2021-01-27

However, studies investigating the effect of open access publishing on citations are typically conducted across a wide variety of journals and disciplines, introducing a number of potential issues and limiting their utility for specific disciplines. Here, I used three primary marine ecology journals with an open access option as a microcosm of scientific publishing to determine whether or not open access articles received more citations than non-open access articles during the same time frame, controlling for self-citations, article type, and journal impact factor. I also tested for the effects of time since publication and the number of authors. Citations were positively correlated with time since publication and differed across the three journals. In addition, open access articles received significantly more citations than non-open access articles. Self-citations increased with author number and were affected by a complex interaction between open access, journal, and time since publication. This study demonstrates that open access articles receive more citations in hybrid marine ecology journals, although the causal factors driving this trend are unknown.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=natscie,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Clements, Jeff C.",,,,J,,FACETS,English,Article,,,,,"[Clements, Jeff C.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Tucker Pk Rd,POB 5050, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada; [Clements, Jeff C.] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Atlantic Vet Coll, Dept Hlth Management, 550 Univ Ave, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada",,30,9,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,2371-1671,,2017,2,,,,10.1139/facets-2016-0032,,,WOS:000363208700001,,2021-01-27

A Quantitative Evaluation of Non-indexed Open Access Journals in Aquaculture Research,ethics; journal selection; open access; peer review; scientific publishing; science communication,"Predatory open access (OA) journals can be defined as non-indexed journals that exploit the gold OA model for profit, often spamming academics with questionable e-mails promising rapid OA publication for a fee. In aquaculture-a rapidly growing and highly scrutinized field-the issue of such journals remains undocumented. We employed a quantitative approach to determine whether attributes of scientific quality and rigor differed between OA aquaculture journals not indexed in reputable databases and well-established, indexed journals. Using a Google search, we identified several non-indexed OA journals, gathered data on attributes of these journals and articles therein, and compared these data to well-established aquaculture journals indexed in quality-controlled bibliometric databases. We then used these data to determine if non-indexed journals were likely predatory OA journals and if they pose a potential threat to aquaculture research. On average, non-indexed OA journals published significantly fewer papers per year, had cheaper fees, and were more recently established than indexed journals. Articles in non-indexed journals were, on average, shorter, had fewer authors and references, and spent significantly less time in peer review than their indexed counterparts; the proportion of articles employing rigorous statistical analyses was also lower for non-indexed journals. Additionally, articles in non-indexed journals were more likely to be published by scientists from developing nations. Worryingly, non-indexed journals were more likely to be found using a Google search, and their articles superficially resembled those in indexed journals. These results suggest that the non-indexed aquaculture journals identified herein are likely predatory OA journals and pose a threat to aquaculture research and the public education and perception of aquaculture. Several points of reference from this study, in combination, may help scientists and the public more easily identify these possibly predatory journals, as these journals were typically established after 2010, publishing <20 papers per year, had fees <$1,000, and published articles <80 days after submission. Subsequently checking reputable and quality-controlled databases such as the Directory of Open Access Journals, Web of Science, Scopus, and Thompson Reuters can aid in confirming the legitimacy of non-indexed OA journals and can facilitate avoidance of predatory OA aquaculture journals.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=agric,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Clements, Jeff C.; Daigle, Remi M.; Froehlich, Halley E.",,,,J,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Clements, Jeff C.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Gulf Fisheries Ctr, Aquaculture & Coastal Ecosyst Sect, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Daigle, Remi M.] Laval Univ, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Froehlich, Halley E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,63,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,2018,5,,,,10.3389/fmars.2018.00106,,,WOS:000363209300002,,2021-01-27

The institutional view, from a survey of academic librarians, is compared to researchers' perceptions and practices. Researchers were largely unaware of their institutions' policies with regard to open access, or whether they had an institutional repository. Reasons for making research outputs available on open access, or not doing so, were sought, and the role of open access material as a research resource investigated. The surveys found that many researchers maintained a suspicion of open access publications, both as authors and as users of scholarly material, together with a degree of ignorance about open access and the role of institutional repositories. This suggests that a degree of culture change may be needed, as institutions develop repositories with a view to future research assessment requirements, and more funders adopt open access mandates for the outputs from research which they fund. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=librarian,geo=GBR,"not accessible, StS uploaded paper",,Creaser C.,,,,,,New Review of Academic Librarianship,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,32,0,13614533,0,2010,16,1,4,25,10.1080/13614530903162854,,,WOS:000373135700014,,2021-01-27

The quality of the journals was assessed by impact factors and the requirements for indexing in PubMed. A total of 552 were published in 2013 in the 19 open-access nursing journals that met the inclusion criteria. No journals had impact factors listed in Web of Knowledge, but three had low Scopus impact factors. Only five journals were indexed with PubMed. The quality of the 19 journals included in the review was evaluated as inferior to most subscription-fee journals. Mental health nursing has some responsibility to the general public, and in particular, consumers of mental health services and their families, for the quality of papers published in open-access journals.

With that in mind, the authors undertook a survey of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in physical science, mathematics, and engineering fields at two research universities (Cornell University and Syracuse University) asking for their experience with and opinion of paying author fees for publication of research in open access journals. The results of this survey indicated that most respondents had not decided against publishing in an open access journal due to the author fee requirement. Those who had paid them only requested or received coverage for those fees in grant line-items or from institutional sources in a few cases.

Design: Survey questionnaire. Setting: The international open access scholarly publishing sector. Subjects: 1,038 researchers across all academic disciplines who have recently published work in open access journals that charge APCs. Methods: Journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals were stratified into seven discipline clusters, and systematic random sampling was used where possible to collect a sample of up to 15 journals per cluster that levy APCs. For each individual journal, the authors of the 15 most recently published articles (working from 2010 backwards) were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire on the factors influencing their choice of journal and the source(s) used to fund processing charges. Additional background information about the authors and journals was also collected and merged with the survey responses. Main Results: The results of the survey identified the fit of the article with the journal's subject area, the perceived quality or impact of the journal, and the speed of the peer-review and publishing process as the dominant factors in the journal selection decision of authors. All three aspects were judged as either ""very important"" or ""important"" by 80% or more of respondents - significantly higher than the corresponding figure of 60% in relation to the open access status of the journal. The analysis also indicated that two key elements appear to influence how APCs are funded: the research discipline and the country of origin of the author. The use of research grants to fund charges is more prevalent in scientific disciplines than in the humanities, whilst researchers based in lower-income countries more frequently identify APCs as a barrier than those in higher-income countries. Grants and institutional funding tend to be the primary sources of funding for journals with higher APCs, whilst personal funding is utilised more often in cases where the fee is less than $500. Conclusion: Despite the increasing focus on the accessibility and visibility of research, academics still appear to place a greater value on 'who' rather than 'how many' readers access their research, and consequently traditional factors still persist as the main determinants in an author's choice of journal. The future success of the APC model, compared with the traditional subscription-based or hybrid models, will ultimately depend on the ability of authors to obtain the necessary funding to pay such charges, combined with the extent to which the quality of services offered by open access publishers is perceived as being commensurate with the associated publishing fees. © 2012 Dalton.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,Dalton M.,,,,,,Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,University of Alberta,1715720X,0,2012,7,4,102,104,10.18438/b8hc87,,,WOS:000378759100011,,2021-01-27

In the contemporary digital era, since scientists are both consumers and producers of data, they inevitably play a crucial role in defining the level of data accessibility. Yet, it is individual researchers usually who resist the release of their data. Through a global online questionnaire survey, the perception of 858 life scientists with respect to open data was investigated. Differences in scientists' perceptions were tested per major country, rank position and academic performance in order to identify partial and global preferences. The 'Selfish Scientist Paradox' was identified: although the majority of respondents were in favour of open access to life sciences data, and most acknowledged that data gathered by others is vital to their work, the same group of people were quite reluctant to share their own data; only a third of them were willing to make their data available unconditionally. Scientists with > 10 yr professional experience were twice as likely to oppose open access, while almost half of junior researchers would rather not share their data prior to publishing. Senior scientists argued that although project funding in general was a significant incentive towards making their data available, at the same time certain confidentiality agreements in some projects become a main barrier to data sharing. Country of professional location largely affected most responses, revealing that southern Europeans had a 'conservative' attitude towards open access, being more unwilling to share their data. Analyses based on academic performance (publications and citations) indicated that established individuals were more dependent on data collected by others and more opposed to open access. © The authors 2018.",a=opendata,m=survey,d=natscie; d=engtech; d=med,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Damalas D., Kalyvioti G., Sabatella E.C., Stergiou K.I.",,,,,,Ethics in Science and Environmental Politics,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,Inter-Research,16118014,0,2018,18,1,27,36,10.3354/esep00182,,,WOS:000379031100004,,2021-01-27

The full register of publications for the YERUN universities was downloaded from Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection, and a set of bibliometric analyses was performed to provide an evidence-based response to the research questions (example: Do YERUN universities follow publication patterns similar to those of their countries of origin? How does OA affect the impact of scientific publications? What types of OA are used at each institution? Is there a relationship between specialization and OA?). The bibliometric analyses looked at four dimensions: activity and context indicators; collaboration indicators; specialization indicators; OA types and impact indicators. The document analysis included variables related to infrastructure, specific support actions, institutional policies and OA information availability. The paper concludes that the institutional measures and actions fostering OA identified on universities' websites bear a correspondence with the bibliometric data. YERUN institutions have higher rates of OA publications than do their host countries, with a clear preference for the green route.

Our study engaged with both journals in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields and the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) and included Hybrid, Diamond and No OA journals. The overall findings demonstrate a positive relationship between APCs and journals with high IF for two of the subject areas we examined but not for the third, which could be mediated by the characteristics and market environment of the publishers. We also found significant differences between the analysed research fields in terms of APC policies, as well as differences in the relationship between APCs and the IF across periodicals.

While there are large repositories of open access articles and free publication indexes, there are still a few examples of free citation networks and their coverage is partial. One of the results is that most of the evaluation processes based on citation counts rely on commercial citation databases. Things are changing under the pressure of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC), whose goal is to campaign for scholarly publishers to make their citations as totally open. This paper investigates the growth of open citations with an experiment on the Italian Scientific Habilitation, the National process for University Professor qualification, which instead uses data from commercial indexes. We simulated the procedure by only using open data and explored similarities and differences with the official results. The outcomes of the experiment show that the amount of open citation data currently available is not yet enough for obtaining similar results. © 2019 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2019 - Proceedings.

The methodology to test this postulate ranges from comparing the impact factors of OA journals versus traditional ones, to comparing citations of OA versus non-OA articles published in the same non-OA journals. However, conclusions are not entirely consistent among fields, and two possible explications have been suggested in those fields where a citation advantage has been observed for OA: the early view and the selection bias postulates. In this study, a longitudinal and multidisciplinary analysis of gold OA citation advantage is developed. All research articles in all journals for all subject categories in the multidisciplinary database Web of Science are considered. A total of 1,138,392 articles-60,566 (5.3%) OA articles and 1,077,826 (94.7%) non-OA articles-published in 2009 are analysed. The citation window considered goes from 2009 to 2014, and data are aggregated for the 249 disciplines (subject categories).

The methodology used to test the OA citation advantage includes comparing OA vs. non-OA journal impact factors and citations of OA vs. non-OA articles published in the same non-OA journals. However, one problem with many studies is that they are small and restricted to one discipline or set of journals-. Moreover, conclusions are not entirely consistent among research areas, and 'early view' and 'selection bias' have been suggested as possible explications. In the present article, an analysis of gold OA from across all areas of research-the 27 subject areas of the Scopus database-is realized. As a novel contribution, this article takes a journal-level approach to assessing the OA citation advantage, whereas many others take a paper-level approach. Data were obtained from Scimago Lab, sorted using Scopus database, and tagged as OA/non-OA using the DOAJ list. Jointly with the OA citation advantage, the OA prevalence as well as the differences between access types (OA vs. non-OA) in production and referencing are tested.

In this study, we analyze three of these factors for journals, conference proceedings and book series: the field (in 316 subject categories of the Scopus database), the access modality (open access vs. paywalled), and the visibility of the source (through the percentile of the average impact in the subject category). We quantify the effect of these factors on the probability of being uncited. This probability is measured through the percentage of uncited documents in the serial sources of the Scopus database at about two years after publication. As a main result, we do not find any strong correlation between open access and uncitedness. Within the group of most cited journals (Q1 and top 10%), open access journals generally have somewhat lower uncited rates. However, in the intermediate quartiles (Q2 and Q3) almost no differences are observed, while for Q4 the uncited rate is again somewhat lower in the case of the OA group.

Data are requested via freedom of information requests, but 5years on, little is known about how the system is working. Methods: Case series of 12 requests for regulatory data (clinical study reports and other regulatory data) relating to 29 different compounds. We logged start and end dates for correspondence with and data releases from the EMA, the need for additional correspondence and appeal of initial negative decisions, and inspected data releases for redaction. We measured: time from initial request to first substantive response from the EMA, to final decision from the EMA (in case of appeal), to initial receipt of documents, and to completion of request; number of data transmission batches generated; number of pages received for each request; average number of pages per batch over time (for releases in multiple batches); judgment as to whether the request was satisfied. Results: We found great variability in time to receive an initial decision from the EMA (1 to 13weeks). Additional correspondence with the EMA was necessary in 10 of 12 requests. Four of 12 were initially refused but 3 of 4 were allowed on appeal after 3 to 33 additional weeks. One request was denied despite appeal. Time to final decision was 1 to 43weeks. We received data for 11 of 12 requests in 98 batches. While two requests remain outstanding as at June 2015 the remaining nine requests took a median 43weeks to completion (range: 17 to 186weeks). Despite redaction in 10 of 11 releases (mainly of researcher and participant identifying information), 8 requested were wholly satisfied. Conclusions: The EMA is the only regulator in the world that is routinely releasing original clinical trial data, but release can take considerable time to occur and often only after a lengthy correspondence. Given its importance for research and significance for transparency we suggest ways in which the process could be made more efficient. © 2016 Doshi and Jefferson.",a=opendata,m=document review,d=med,t=other,geo=EU,,,"Doshi P., Jefferson T.",,,,,,Trials,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,18,BioMed Central Ltd.,17456215,0,2016,17,1,0,0,10.1186/s13063-016-1194-7,,,WOS:000392884700005,,2021-01-27

We describe a single, searchable database of all emergency medicine and critical care journals that include their open access policies, publication costs, and impact metrics. Methods: A list of emergency medicine and critical care journals (including citation metrics) was created using Scopus (Citescore) and the Web of Science (Impact Factor). Cost of gold/hybrid open access and article process charges (open access fees) were collected from journal websites. Self-archiving policies were collected from the Sherpa/RoMEO database. Relative cost of access in different regions were calculated using the World Bank Purchasing Power Parity index for authors from the United States, Germany, Turkey, China, Brazil, South Africa and Australia. Results: We identified 78 emergency medicine and 82 critical care journals. Median Citescore for emergency medicine was 0.73 (interquartile range, IQR 0.32-1.27). Median impact factor was 1.68 (IQR 1.00-2.39). Median Citescore for critical care was 0.95 (IQR 0.25-2.06). Median impact factor was 2.18 (IQR 1.73-3.50). Mean article process charge for emergency medicine was $2243.04, SD=$ 1136.16 and for critical care $2201.64, SD=$1174.38. Article process charges were 2.24, 1.75, 2.28 and 1.56 times more expensive for South African, Chinese, Turkish and Brazilian authors respectively than United States authors, but neutral for German and Australian authors (1.02 and 0.81 respectively).

Universities and research institutions set up OA policies and provide authors different types of support for engaging in OA activities. This paper presents a case study on OA publishing in a scholarly community, drawing on qualitative and quantitative data gained from workshops and a survey. As the authors are the managing editors of theOA eJournal for eDemocracy and Open Government(JeDEM), the aim was to collect data and insights on the publication choices of authors interested in OA publishing and other crucial factors such as personal attitudes to publishing, institutional context, and digital literacy in order to improve the journal. In the first phase, two workshops with different stakeholders were held at the Conference for e-Democracy and Open Government (CeDEM) held in Austria and in South Korea in 2016. In the second phase, an online survey was sent to all the users of the e-journal JeDEM in October 2019. From the workshops, key differences regarding OA perception and strategies between the stakeholder groups were derived. Participants strongly perceived OA publishing as a highly individualist matter embedded within a publishing culture emphasizing reputation and rankings. The survey results, however, showed that institutional support differs considerably for authors. Factors such as visibility, reputation, and impact play the biggest role for the motivation to publish OA. The results from both inquiries provide a better understanding of OA publishing attitudes and the relevant digital literacies but also suggest the need to investigate further the enablers or difficulties of scholarship, particularly in a digital context. They clearly point to the potential of regularly addressing the users of the journal as well as communicating with them the more nuanced aspects of OA publishing, non-traditional metrics, or respective digital literacies, in order to reduce misconceptions about OA and to support critical stances.",a=openaccess,m=survey; m=other,d=socscie,t=researchers,geo=nonspecific,,,"Edelmann, Noella; Schossboeck, Judith",,,,J,,PUBLICATIONS,English,Article,,,,,"[Edelmann, Noella; Schossboeck, Judith] Danube Univ Krems, Dept E Governance & Adm, A-3500 Krems, Austria",,59,0,MDPI,,,2020,8,3,,,10.3390/publications8030044,,,WOS:000396464900002,,2021-01-27

The main aim of the study is to find out the characteristics of open access repositories, their development scenario and ranking in web repositories as well as to recommend some suggestions for the development of open access repositories in Bangladesh. The methodology includes a quantitative approach. The data were collected from OpenDOAR from 20 to 29 August 2017. The scope of the study is confined to Bangladeshi repositories indexed in the OpenDOAR database. The findings of the study show that the Bangladeshi repositories are embodied in the Ranking of Web Repositories. The study also clearly indicates the very slow progress of open access repositories in Bangladesh. The repositories in Bangladesh listed in OpenDOAR are mostly institutional in nature. The study also reveals that a maximum number of repositories are small in terms of collection. It can be easily summarized that there is a need for public awareness regarding the concept of open access repositories in Bangladesh to support research and development. This paper is the first attempt in Bangladesh to discuss and analyze the overall scenario of open access repositories.

Gold OAP is a common form of OAP where the author pays an article processing charge (APC) to make the article freely available to readers. However, gold OAP is a cause for concern because it drives a redistribution of valuable research money to support open access papers in mega-journals' with more permissive acceptance criteria. We present a data-driven evaluation of the financial ramifications of gold OAP and provide evidence that gold OAP in mega-journals is biased toward Western industrialized countries. From 2011 to 2015, the period of our data collection, countries with developing economies had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in the lower-tier mega-journals and thus paid article APCs that cross-subsidize publications in the top-tier journals of the same publisher. Conversely, scientists from Western developed countries had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in those same top-tier journals. The global inequity of the cross-subsidizing APC model was demonstrated across five different mega-journals, showing that the issue is a common problem. We need to develop stringent and fair criteria that address the global financial implications of OAP, as publication fees should reflect the real cost of publishing and be transparent for authors.",a=openaccess,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Ellers, Jacintha; Crowther, Thomas W.; Harvey, Jeffrey A.",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING,English,Article,,,,,"[Ellers, Jacintha] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Evolutionary Ecol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,9,5,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,1198-9742,,2017,49,1,89,102,10.3138/jsp.49.1.89,,,WOS:000398300300014,,2021-01-27

Sample: A sample of 1910 gold OA journals has been obtained by combining Scopus SJR 2012, the DOAJ, and data provided by previous studies (Solomon, 2013). Method: We have divided the SJR index into quartiles for all journals' subject areas. First, we show descriptive statistics by combining quartiles based on their features. Then, after having converted the quartiles into a dummy variable, we test it as a dependent variable in a binary logistic regression. Contribute: This work contributes empirically to better understanding the gold OA efficacy of data analysis, which may be helpful in improving journals' rankings in the areas where this is still a struggle. Findings: Significant results have been found for all variables, except for the types of publishers, and for born or converted journals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows the volume of OA journals, proportion of publications in OA journals and the quality of these journals in comparison with subscription-based counterparts. Design/methodology/approach - This research investigated 22,256 active peer-reviewed journals indexed by Scopus in 2015. Data were gathered using the Journal Metrics website. The current research adopted four indicators to compare the quality of OA and non-OA journals indexed in Scopus under each subject area, namely citedness rate, CiteScore, SNIP and SJR. Findings - OA journals comprised approximately 17 per cent out of the total journals indexed by Scopus in 2015. The results revealed an uneven spread of OA journals across disciplines, ranged from 5.5 to 28.7 per cent. Studying the quality of journals as measured by CiteScore, SJR SNIP leads us to the finding that, in all research areas, except for health profession and nursing, non-OA journals attain statistically significant higher average quality than do OA journals.

The current research is conducted with the aim of providing better insights into the increasingly important OAMJ phenomenon through investigation of eight reputable titles using established bibliometric methods. Results of the study showed that eight studied OAMJs were responsible for 1.87% of the total number of publication indexed in Web of Science during 2012-2016. Despite the decline in publication count of PLOS ONE over the past couple of years, it was the biggest journal in the world till 2017, when Scientific Reports overtook PLOS ONE as the most productive journal. Over 88% of the papers published in eight selected OAMJs were cited at-least once at the point in time of analysis. The highest proportions of cited and un-cited documents were seen in Scientific Reports and SpringerPlus, respectively. With regard to the three indicators, namely share of highly-cited papers, the category normalized citation impact as well as the JIF percentile, IEEE Access had by far the best performance among eight examined OAMJs. Results of the study revealed that Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Neurosciences, Oncology and Immunology were the most commonly assigned subject categories to OAMJs' content. The National Natural Science Foundation of China was the most important funding agency that supported the publication of around 26000 articles in eight studied OAMJs. Investigation of the geographic distribution of authors showed that the United States and China by far had the highest contribution in the content of eight studied OAMJs.

Findings - From the findings 15 local content materials were identified as relevant for publication in institutional repositories. Similarly a major method of acquiring these local contents is by encouraging staff to deposit their publications in the university libraries. It was also found out that providing a subject index to the local contents and their digitization were effective methods of organizing the materials for the institutional repository. The findings also showed that an increase in the visibility of the authors, promotion of university ranking and efficient dissemination of research findings were among the benefits of publishing in institutional repositories. The problems and strategies of publishing in institutional repositories were also identified through the findings. Practical implications - This study will serve as a useful guide for university administrators and librarians who are interested in developing their institutional repositories using local contents available to them. It will also be of great value to project managers who are engaged in the digitization of their local contents. Social implications - Research works generated in Nigeria and other developing countries are poorly disseminated and therefore lack global visibility.

It appears however that the former attracts more attention. Here emphasis lies in the access to and preservation of research output. Yet, it is on the supply-side regarding the acquisition of research output that persistent identifiers may by the same token have influence in identifying and populating prospective data archives and repositories. This study will look at the influence persistent identifiers have in securing the acquisition of grey literature for public access. The goal of this project is twofold. First, to carry out a survey within the grey literature community as to the opinions, uses, and applications of persistent identifiers. And second, to initiate a project geared to populate a new collection housed in the GreyGuide Repository3 by using the DOI as an incentive. Resources in Grey Literature (RGL) is as a generic, multidisciplinary collection that will serve for this purpose. Using GreyNet’s distribution channels and social media, stakeholders in the field of grey literature are invited to enter one or more of their publications in the RGL collection. Each new entry will receive a DOI minted by GreyNet International and further stored and preserved in the DataCite registry4. Also, a system generated citation will be added to each new entry in order to facilitate record use. The types of grey literature documents eligible for entry in the RGL collection are numerous5. Brief guidelines for record entry require that it be self-archived using the existing online-template and that both the metadata record and accompanying full-text document(s) are in English. An additional descriptive field does allow for entry in another language. And, a translation of the document can also be uploaded in the repository. Finally, it is understood that by submitting the metadata record and file(s), they become open access compliant under Creative Commons license CC-BY-SA6. The initial phase of the project commenced in April 2019 and closed in October 2019. Records harvested during this period along with the results of the survey will be analyzed in its second phase. In the final phase, the project’s outcome will be published.

Despite its potential to further scientific progress, widespread data sharing in small science is still an ideal practised in moderation. In this article, we explore the question of what drives open access to research data using a survey among 1564 mainly German researchers across all disciplines. We show that, regardless of their disciplinary background, researchers recognize the benefits of open access to research data for both their own research and scientific progress as a whole.

While the OScH movement aims to reduce barriers for scientific experimentation both in and beyond professional labs, disseminating OScH for widespread adoption proves to be challenging in practice. To this end, we examined real-world practices related to the dissemination of OScH through a two-part study. First, we developed an open science hardware, a DIY incubator, and disseminated it through the Instructables website and maker workshops. In parallel, we interviewed eight open science hardware practitioners from different parts of the world. Insights from interviews together with our own self-reflections revealed how different OScH dissemination modalities serve unique purposes. Our findings also reveal several challenges for widespread adoption of OScH and the importance of collaborations between OScH developers. We conclude by discussing the opportunities for HCI to lower barriers for customization, support internationalization of OScH, and scaffold proactive distributed collaborations between developers and users. © 2020 ACM.",a=opentools,m=other; m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=other,geo=AF; geo=SA; geo=USA; geo=EU; geo=AS,no access to fulltext; added full text,,"Fernando P., Kuznetsov S.",,,,,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,English,Conference Paper,"2020 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2020",25 April 2020 through 30 April 2020,0,,,,,0,Association for Computing Machinery,0,9781450367080,2020,0,0,0,0,10.1145/3313831.3376659,,,WOS:000407839000004,,2021-01-27

There are new paradigms of scientific communication such as open access repositories that must be exploited to provide academic and research free content, so that the scientific production is globally accessible to society. The aim of this study is to report the benefits of scientific communication model through open access repositories, using as an example the Revista de la Sociedad Otorrinolaringológica Castilla y León, Cantabria y La Rioja deposited and disseminated through Gredos, the Institutional Repository of the University of Salamanca. Method: We present the fundamentals, the state of the art, trends and benefits of open access, understood as a radical change in the system of scientific communication. They are defined and analyzed repositories, which are the ""green road"" to get open access to knowledge. Results: Open Access Repositories are a new way to spread scientific journals so that papers published in them achieve maximum exposure and visibility, increasing the rate of citation. Discussion: The study focuses on the repositories and on the deposit of scientific articles in repositories, specifically in the case of Gredos institutional repository of the University of Salamanca, to explain the advantages of the dissemination of the contents of the Revista de la Societdad Otorrinolaringológica Castilla y León, Cantabria y La Rioja through the repository Gredos, emphasizing the increased visibility of the scientific content hosted in the repository Gredos.
Conclusions: Currently the movement for open access is sufficiently consolidated as evidenced by the data presented in this paper. Repositories are a key element in the development of this movement, offering multiple benefits to authors, institutions and the general public. The Journal of the Sociedad Otorrinolaringológica de Castilla y León, Cantabria and La Rioja diffused through the repository of Gredos will increase the content visibility and the rate of citation, while contributing to the public good.",a=opentools; a=openaccess,m=document review,d=med,t=librarian; t=researcher,geo=ESP,"exclude because neither journal article nor proceeding, no fulltext; spanish,  StS: full text uploaded",,"Ferreras-Fernandez, Transito",,,,J,,REVISTA DE LA SOCIEDAD OTORRINOLARINGOLOGICA DE CASTILLA Y LEON CANTABRIA Y LA RIOJA,Spanish,Article,,,,,"[Ferreras-Fernandez, Transito] Univ Salamanca, Serv Bibliotecas, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",,1,0,SOC CASTILE & LEON CANTABRIA & RIOJA,2341-1503,,2015,6,,33,65,,,,WOS:000407885400006,,2021-01-27

Since the late 2000s numerous international organizations, inter-governmental bodies and governments have issued open government data policies, which set out key principles underpinning access to, and the release and reuse of data. These policies reiterate the value of government data and establish the default position that it should be openly accessible to the public under transparent and non-discriminatory conditions, which are conducive to innovative reuse of the data. A key principle stated in open government data policies is that legal rights in government information must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with and supports the open accessibility and reusability of the data. In particular, where government information and data is protected by copyright, access should be provided under licensing terms which clearly permit its reuse and dissemination. This principle has been further developed in the policies issued by Australian Governments into a specific requirement that Government agencies are to apply the Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY) as the default licensing position when releasing government information and data. A wide-ranging survey of the practices of Australian Government agencies in managing their information and data, commissioned by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in 2012, provides valuable insights into progress towards the achievement of open government policy objectives and the adoption of open licensing practices. The survey results indicate that Australian Government agencies are embracing open access and a proactive disclosure culture and that open licensing under Creative Commons licences is increasingly prevalent. However, the finding that ""[t]he default position of open access licensing is not clearly or robustly stated, nor properly reflected in the practice of Government agencies? points to the need to further develop the policy framework and the principles governing information access and reuse, and to provide practical guidance tools on open licensing if the broadest range of government information and data is to be made available for innovative reuse.

Design/methodology/approach - Extent of visibility is explored by quantitative analysis of institutional repository and OA journals data sets followed by qualitative analysis of OA foundation documents and literature on OA in Africa published mainly between 2003 and 2013. Findings - Visibility in institutional repositories or OA journals for African researchers remains low. Causes include insufficient educational support for librarians and administrators in required new roles; inability of national, organisational and technological infrastructures to support OA; impracticality of western-based and costly publishing models; and disincentives relating to intellectual property and researcher perceptions. Complex language and literacy issues also inhibit engagement. Recommendations include strong OA advocacy, development of support initiatives, integration of international knowledge for local conditions and vice versa, sensitive preservation of indigenous knowledge and development of mechanisms of funding and research assessment mechanisms, which are economically and technically viable. Originality/value - Earlier attempts were made to raise awareness about the lack of uptake of OA in Africa. This paper shows that the situation has hardly changed and now requires urgent attention. Otherwise OA will not become the default method for distributing new peer-reviewed research in every field and country by 2022 (BOAI, 2012).",a=openaccess,m=biblio; m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=AF,,,"Fox, Moya; Hanlon, Susannah Micaela",,,,J,,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,English,Article,,,,,"[Fox, Moya] Univ Dundee, Lib & Learning Ctr, Dundee, Scotland; [Hanlon, Susannah Micaela] Northumbria Univ, Dept Math & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",,63,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,1468-4527,,2015,39,5,698,716,10.1108/OIR-05-2015-0147,,,WOS:000412492800001,,2021-01-27

Open-access literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Self-archiving or deposit of scholarly outputs in institutional repositories (open-access green route) is increasingly present in the activities of the scientific community. Besides the benefits of open access for visibility and dissemination of science, it is increasingly more often required by funding agencies to deposit papers and any other type of documents in repositories. In the biomedical environment this is even more relevant by the impact scientific literature can have on public health. However, to make self-archiving feasible, authors should be aware of its meaning and the terms in which they are allow to archive their works. In that sense, there are some tools like Sherpa/RoMEO or DULCINEA (both directories of copyright licences of scientific journals at different levels) to find out what rights are retained by authors when they publish a paper and if they allow to implement self-archiving. Pub Med Central and its British and Canadian counterparts are the main thematic repositories for biomedical fields. In our country there is none of similar nature, but most of the universities and CSIC, have already created their own institutional repositories. Conclusion. The increase in visibility of research results and their impact on a greater and earlier citation is one of the most frequently advance of open access, but removal of economic barriers to access to information is also a benefit to break borders between groups.",a=openaccess; opentools,m=document review,d=med,t=other,geo=ESP,"exclusion: language…and possibly no empirical study; no access to publication to verify: https://www.neurologia.com/articulo/2009628

857,WOS,thomas_loesch,Attracted to open access journals: A bibliometric author analysis in the field of biology,Developing countries; Publications; Research,"Purpose - Scholars from developing countries have limited access to research publications due to expensive subscription costs. However, the open access movement is challenging the constraint to access. Consequently, researchers in developing countries are often mentioned as major recipients of the benefits when advocating open access (OA). One of the implications of that argument is that authors from developing countries are more likely to perceive open access positively than authors from developed countries. The present study aims to investigate the use of open access by researchers from developing countries and is thus a supplement to the existing author surveys and interviews. Design/methodology/approach - Bibliometric analyses of both publishing behaviour and citing behaviour in relation to OA publishing provides evidence of the impact of open access on developing countries. Findings - The results of the multivariate linear regression show that open access journals are not characterised by a different composition of authors from the traditional toll access journals. Furthermore, the results show that authors from developing countries do not cite open access more than authors from developed countries. Originality/value - The paper argues that authors from developing countries are not attracted to open access more than authors from developed countries. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

However, there are only a few studies on the acceptance and thereby integration of these OAJs in the scholarly communication system. Even fewer studies provide insight into the differences across disciplines. This study is an analysis of the citing behaviour in journals within three science fields: biology, mathematics, and pharmacy and pharmacology. It is a statistical analysis of OAJs as well as non-OAJs including both the citing and cited side of the journal to journal citations. The multivariate linear regression reveals many similarities in citing behaviour across fields and media. But it also points to great differences in the integration of OAJs. The integration of OAJs in the scholarly communication system varies considerably across fields. The implications for bibliometric research are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past they have been disseminated through various channels of informal communication. However, the Internet has enabled dissemination of these un-published and often unrefereed publications to a much wider audience. This is particularly interesting seen in relation to the highly disputed open access advantage as the potential advantage for low visibility publications has not been given much attention in the literature. The present study examines the role of working papers in economics during a 10-year period (1996-2005). It shows that working papers are increasingly becoming visible in the field specific databases. The impact of working papers is relatively low;  however, high impact working paper series have citation rate levels similar to the low impact journals in the field. There is no tendency to an increase in impact during the 10 years which is the case for the high impact journals. Consequently, the result of this study does not provide evidence of an open access advantage for working papers in economics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea that peer-reviewed OA publication leads to higher rates of citation has been put forth and shown to be true in several publications. This is a significant benefit to authors and is in addition to another relatively less obvious but highly critical component of the OA charter, i.e. retention of the copyright by the authors in the public domain. In this study, we analyzed the citation rates of OA and traditional non-OA publications specifically for authors in the field of cytopathology. Design: We compared the citation patterns for authors who had published in both OA and traditional non-OA peer-reviewed, scientific, cytopathology journals. Citations in an OA publication (CytoJournal) were analyzed comparatively with traditional non-OA cytopathology journals (Acta Cytologica, Cancer Cytopathology, Cytopathology, and Diagnostic Cytopathology) using the data from web of science citation analysis site (based on which the impact factors (IF) are calculated). After comparing citations per publication, as well as a time adjusted citation quotient (which takes into account the time since publication), we also analyzed the statistics after excluding the data for meeting abstracts. Results: Total 28 authors published 314 publications as articles and meeting abstracts (25 authors after excluding the abstracts). The rate of citation and time adjusted citation quotient were higher for OA in the group where abstracts were included (P < 0.05 for both). The rates were also slightly higher for OA than non-OA when the meeting abstracts were excluded, but the difference was statistically insignificant (P = 0.57 and P = 0.45). Conclusion : We observed that for the same author, the publications in the OA journal attained a higher rate of citation than the publications in the traditional non-OA journals in the field of cytopathology over a 5 year period (2007-2011). However, this increase was statistically insignificant if the meeting abstracts were excluded from the analysis.

873,WOS,thomas_loesch,Open science in e-science: contingency or policy?,Communications;  Research methods,"Purpose - This paper seeks to discuss the question of openness in e-Science. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on 12 in-depth interviews with principal investigators, project managers and developers involved in UK e-Science projects, together with supporting documentary evidence from project web sites. The approach was to explore the juxtaposition of research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level. Interview questions focused on research inputs, software development processes, access to resources, project documentation, dissemination of outputs and by-products, licensing issues, and institutional contracts. Findings - The findings suggest that, although there is a widely shared ethos of openness in everyday research practice, there are many uncertainties and yet-to-be resolved issues, despite strong policy imperatives towards openly shared resources. Research limitations/implications - The paper concludes by observing a stratification of openness in practice and the need for more nuanced understanding of openness at the level of policy making. This research was based on interviews within a limited number of e-Science/Social Science projects and the intention is to address this in future work by scaling the study up to a survey that will reach the entire UK e-Science/Social Science community. Practical implications - The fundamental challenge in resolving openness in practice and policy, land thereby moving towards a sustainable infrastructure for e-Science, is the coordination and integration of goals across e-Science efforts, rather than one of resolving IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues, which has been the central focus of openness debates thus far. Originality/value-The question of openness has previously been posed on the macro-level of research policy, e.g. whether science as a whole can be characterized as open science, or in relation to the dissemination of published outputs, e.g. Open Access.

The empirical data are taken from two online surveys of European authors. Taking a domain analytic approach, the analysis draws on Becher and Trowler's (2001) and Whitley's (2000) theories to gain a deeper understanding of why OA repositories (OAR) play a particularly important role in the chosen disciplines. The surveys provided a unique opportunity to compare perceptions, motivations, and behaviors of researchers at the discipline level with the parent metadiscipline. It should be noted that participants were not drawn from a stratified sample of all the different subdisciplines that constitute each discipline, and therefore the generalizability of the findings to the discipline may be limited. The differential role of informal and formal communication in each of the three disciplines has shaped green OA practices. For physicists and economists, preprints are an essential feature of their respective OAR landscapes, whereas for clinical medics final published articles have a central role. In comparing the disciplines with their parent metadisciplines there were some notable similarities/differences, which have methodological implications for studying research cultures.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=natscie; d=med; d=socscie,t=researcher,geo=EU,,,"Fry, Jenny; Spezi, Valerie; Probets, Stephen; Creaser, Claire",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Fry, Jenny] Univ Loughborough, Sch Arts English & Drama, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Spezi, Valerie; Creaser, Claire] Univ Loughborough, Ctr Informat Management, Sch Business & Econ, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Probets, Stephen] Univ Loughborough, Dept Comp Sci, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,41,10,WILEY,2330-1635,,2016,67,11,2710,2724,10.1002/asi.23621,,,WOS:000416779300039,,2021-01-27

Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses 81 UK university copyright policies to understand what proportion make a claim over: IP ownership of all outputs; the copyright in scholarly works; re-using scholarly works in specific ways; and approaches to moral rights. Results are cross-tabulated by policy age and mission group. Findings - Universities have not asserted their interest in scholarly works through joint ownership, leaving research funders and publishers to set open access policy. The paper finds an increased proportion of universities assert a generic claim to all IP (87 per cent) relative to earlier studies. In total, 74 per cent of policies relinquished rights in scholarly works in favour of academic staff; 20 per cent of policies share ownership of scholarly works through licensing; 28 per cent of policies assert the right to re-use scholarly works in some way; and 32 per cent of policies seek to protect moral rights. Policies that share ownership of scholarly works are more recent. The UK Scholarly Communication Licence (UK-SCL) should have an impact on this area. The reliance on individual academics to enforce a copyright policy or not to opt-out of the UK-SCL could be problematic.

Tracking twelve years of changes to journal publisher self-archiving policies,Embargo periods;  green open access;  institutional repository;  publisher policies;  self-archiving,"Traces the 12-year self-archiving policy journey of the original 107 publishers listed on the SHERPA/RoMEO Publisher Policy Database in 2004, through to 2015. Maps the RoMEO colour codes ('green', 'blue', 'yellow' and 'white') and related restrictions and conditions over time. Finds that while the volume of publishers allowing some form of self-archiving (pre-print, post-print or both) has increased by 12% over the 12 years, the volume of restrictions around how, where and when self-archiving may take place has increased 119%, 190% and 1000% respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the increase in self-archiving restrictions and the introduction of Gold paid open access options. Suggests that by conveying only the version of a paper that authors may self-archive, the RoMEO colour codes do not address all the key elements of the Bethesda Definition of Open Access. Compares the number of RoMEO 'green' publishers over time with those meeting the definition for 'redefined green' (allowing embargo-free deposit of the post-print in an institutional repository). Finds that RoMEO 'green' increased by 8% and 'redefined green' decreased by 35% over the 12 years. Concludes that the RoMEO colour codes no longer convey a commitment to green open access as originally intended.

A publisher's RoMEO colour code, whether they offered a Gold OA option, and the mean number of restrictions as to when, how and where papers may be self-archived, were all mapped. Kruskal-Wallis tests were run to assess whether the differences between their 2004 and 2016 positions were statistically significant. Finds that the growth of Green and Gold OA policy approaches has not been evenly distributed amongst publishers with some significant differences amongst publishers of different size, types and country (UK and US). Large commercial publishers are more likely to be allocated a RoMEO colour code, but at the same time place a high volume of restrictions as to where and how authors might self-archive. Small publishers are less likely to have a RoMEO green colour code, but the volume of restrictions they place on self-archiving are minimal. University presses appear not to be engaging with either OA agenda to any considerable degree. UK and US publishers' OA policies appear to be influenced by the national OA policy environment which, considering the global nature of the scholarly journals market, was more pronounced than might have been anticipated.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=GBR; geo=USA,,,"Gadd, Elizabeth; Fry, Jenny; Creaser, Claire",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Gadd, Elizabeth; Fry, Jenny; Creaser, Claire] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",,33,4,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2018,115,3,1371,1393,10.1007/s11192-018-2716-8,,,WOS:000418772300019,,2021-01-27

It uses Google Scholar, Unpaywall and Open Access Button to identify OA copies of a random sample of articles copied under the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA) HE Licence to support teaching. The quantitative data analysis is combined with interviews of, and a workshop with, HE practitioners to investigate four research questions. Firstly, what is the nature of the content being used to support courses of study? Secondly, do UK HE establishments regularly incorporate searches for open access availability into their acquisition processes to support teaching? Thirdly, what proportion of content used under the CLA Licence is also available on open access and appropriately licenced? Finally, what percentage of content used by UK HEIs under the CLA Licence is written by academics and thus has the potential for being made open access had there been support in place to enable this? Key findings include the fact that no interviewees incorporated OA searches into their acquisitions processes. Overall, 38% of articles required to support teaching were available as OA in some form but only 7% had a findable re-use licence; just 3% had licences that specifically permitted inclusion in an 'electronic course-pack'. Eighty-nine percent of journal content was written by academics (34% by UK-based academics).

Analysis of context-related information and users' comments in open datasets,Accessibility; Open data; Data literacy; Civic engagement; Open data usage; Data and context,"Purpose This paper aims to examine the nature and sufficiency of descriptive information included in open datasets and the nature of comments and questions users write in relation to specific datasets. Open datasets are provided to facilitate civic engagement and government transparency. However, making the data available does not guarantee usage. This paper examined the nature of context-related information provided together with the datasets and identified the challenges users encounter while using the resources. Design/methodology/approach The authors extracted descriptive text provided together with (often at the top of) datasets (N = 216) and the nature of questions and comments users post in relation to the dataset. They then segmented text descriptions and user comments into idea units and applied open-coding with constant comparison method. This allowed them to come up with thematic issues that descriptions focus on and the challenges users encounter. Findings Results of the analysis revealed that context-related descriptions are limited and normative. Users are expected to figure out how to use the data. Analysis of user comments/questions revealed four areas of challenge they encounter: organization and accessibility of the data, clarity and completeness, usefulness and accuracy and language (spelling and grammar). Data providers can do more to address these issues. Research limitations/implications - The purpose of the study is to understand the nature of open data provision and suggest ways of making open data more accessible to non expert users. As such, it is not focused on generalizing about open data provision in various countries as such provision may be different based on jurisdiction. Practical implications - The study provides insight about ways of organizing open dataset that the resource can be accessible by the general public. It also provides suggestions about how open data providers could consider users' perspectives including providing continuous support. Originality/value Research on open data often focuses on technological, policy and political perspectives. Arguably, this is the first study on analysis of context-related information in open-datasets. Datasets do not speak for themselves because they require context for analysis and interpretation.

However, the impact of paywalls on the consumption of academic articles is unclear. We provide novel evidence on this question by exploiting a natural experiment in which six high-impact, usually gated AERA journals became open access for a 2-month period in 2017. Using monthly download data and an always-open-access journal as a comparison group, we show that making journals open access likely increased article downloads in those journals by 55% to 95% per month.

Although the Open Access publication model is already well established in the natural sciences, there seems to be more resistance towards Open Access in the social sciences, including the field of vocational education and training research. The research project Open Access in Vocational Education and Training Research aims to uncover the conditions influencing the acceptance, dissemination and use of Open Access in vocational education and training research. The project is grounded in a sociology of knowledge approach and in media theory. It comprises of two parts. First, four structured group discussions are conducted as focus groups and analysed using a qualitative content analysis. This paper focusses on this first part of the research project, the implementation and analysis of the group discussions as well as the results thereof. The second part of the research project will be based on an online questionnaire built upon these results. The questionnaire will be sent out to authors involved in vocational education and training research in the second part of the research project. Findings: The analysis of the group discussions reveals several thematic clusters. According to group discussion participants, the scope of their publications as well as transparent quality assurance procedures in publishing are particularly relevant. The reputation of their chosen publication medium is another central aspect. It also becomes clear that in some cases an information deficit regarding the financing of Open Access publications or accompanying licensing models exists.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors' web-based data sources for journal-based metrics were the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Thomson Reuters (Journal Citation Reports [JCR], which provided journal impact factors [JIF]) and Scopus (source normalized impact per paper [SNIP] and SCImago journal rank [SJR]). The authors obtained information about journals published before 2000 to 2014. From the JCR, JIF, Rank in Category, Total Journals in Category, Journal Rank in Category, and Quartile in Category were used. Findings - The authors' identified 1,407 OAJ published in D-8 countries. Egypt published the most journals (490) and Bangladesh the fewest (29). Egypt, Iran and Turkey accounted for approximately 73.5 per cent of all journals. At the time of study, 10,162 journals were registered in DOAJ, and 13.8 per cent of them were published in D-8 countries. The mean JIF for all journals from individual countries was highest for Pakistan (0.84), followed by Iran (0.74) and Turkey (0.57). The mean SNIP for all journals from each country was highest for Nigeria (0.57), followed by Egypt (0.57) and Pakistan (0.51). Practical implications - The widespread use of OA publishing models in D-8 countries will boost accessibility of their journals' content and ultimately impact research in D-8 states.

More than one-third (38 per cent) of the journals the authors studied used a Creative Commons (CC) BY license, a hallmark of OA research findings. Most of the journals with a JIF were in the JCR Medical Sciences category (60 per cent).

We used a sample of journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) science class and its 13 subclasses and recorded four citation metrics: JIF, H-index, citations per publication (CPP) and quartile rank. We examined 1881 science journals indexed in DOAJ. Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports and Web of Science were used to extract JIF, H-index, CPP and quartile category. Overall, the JIF, H-index and CPP indicated that APC and non-APC open access (OA) journals had equal impact. Quartile category ranking indicated a difference in favour of APC journals. In each science subclass, we found significant differences between APC and non-APC journals in all citation metrics except for quartile rank. Discipline-related variations were observed in non-APC journals. Differences in the rank positions of scores in different groups identified citation advantages for non-APC journals in physiology, zoology, microbiology and geology, followed by botany, astronomy and general biology. Impact ranged from moderate to low in physics, chemistry, human anatomy, mathematics, general science and natural history. The results suggest that authors should consider field- and discipline-related differences in the OA citation advantage, especially when they are considering non-APC OA journals categorised in two or more subjects.

Even if at early stage, private companies also are adapting to the open data market. A survey was conducted to which thirteen companies of different size (from micro enterprises to world-leading pharmas) in the pharmaceutical and biotech sector and representing four business models archetypes of companies exploiting open data (aggregators, developers, enrichers and enablers) participated. The information collected provides a snapshot of the use of open data by the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in 2015-2016. The companies interviewed use open data to complement proprietary data for research purposes, to implement licensing-in/licensing-out strategies, to map partnerships and connections among players or to identify key expertise and hire staff. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies have made of the protection of knowledge a dogma at the foundation of their business models, but using and contributing to the open data movement may change their approach to intellectual property and innovation. © 2017 The Author(s).",a=opendata,m=survey,d=med,t=business,geo=nonspecific,"m=case study, d=med - pharmaceutical; relevant for this survey?

In 2015, the World Health Organization adopted an open data policy recommendation in such situations. Objectives The present cross-sectional meta-research study aimed to assess the availability of open data and metrics of articles pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak in five high-impact journals. Methods All articles regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), published in five high-impact journals (Ann Intern Med,BMJ,JAMA,NEJMandLancet) until March 14, 2020 were retrieved. Metadata (namely the type of article, number of authors, number of patients, citations, errata, news and social media mentions) were extracted for each article in each journal in a systematic way. Google Scholar and Scopus were used for citations and author metrics respectively, and Altmetrics and PlumX were used for news and social media mentions retrieval. The degree of adherence to the PHEIC open data call was also evaluated. Results A total of 140 articles were published until March 14, 2020, mostly opinion papers. Sixteen errata followed these publications. The number of authors in each article ranged from 1 to 63, whereas the number of patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reached 2645. Extensive hyperauthorship was evident among case studies. The impact of these publications reached a total of 4210 cumulative crude citations and 342 790 news and social media mentions. Only one publication (0.7%) provided complete open data, while 32 (22.9%) included patient data.

Design/methodology/approach - The following parameters were used to characterize the chosen countries. On one hand, it takes social context indicators like digital opportunity index (DOI), GDP 2007 (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) (www.oecd.org/home/3305,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html), scientific output 2005, and investment in science and technology vs GDP 2004. On the other hand, it analyses open access indicators considering the two main open access strategies - the green and gold routes - and the existing legal framework. Findings - This paper discusses the evolution of DOI and compares with open access parameters (numbers of repositories, number of registries in repositories, DOAJ journals and number of creative commons licences) in the context of scientific information in developing countries in Latin America. Research limitations/implications - This paper is not an exhaustive survey and limits the comparison to the Latin American Countries, focalized in Brazil, Chile and Argentina.

This paper studies the influence of both publication modalities on the average impact of the journal and its evolution over time. It tries to identify the separate effect of access on citation into two major parts: early view and selection effect, managing to provide some evidence of the positive effect of both. Scopus is used as the database and CiteScore as the measure of journal impact. The prevalence of both publication modalities is quantified. Differences in the average impact factor of group of journals, according to their publication modalities, are tested. The evolution over time of the citation influence, from 2011 to 2016, is also analysed. Finally, a linear regression to explain the correlation of these publication practices with the CiteScore in 2016, in a ceteris paribus context, is estimated. Our main findings show evidence of a positive correlation between average journal impact and advancing the publication of accepted articles, moreover this correlation increases over time.

In this context, public administration must be transparent and they should release reliable data on how the disease evolver in order to promote accountability and citizens' right to public information. Although political authority was concentrated under the Spanish Government's single chain of command, the regional governments have preserved a notable margin of discretion to implement its decisions. Consequently, this paper analyzes open data initiatives carried out by the 19 Spanish regional governments, which are the basis for transparency. For each of the regions we studied seven variables related to open data's technical features and additional data breakdown. Our results reveal that, although most of the regional governments have offered data on Covid-19, the situation is quite heterogeneous, especially in terms of reusability and breakdown of available data.

It is a paradigm shift in the academic society which hammered up the traditional publishing and unlatched the doors of knowledge to reader community. One of the main drives of open access is to make academic research more easily available and maximum exploitation of resources. Objectives: This study aims to elucidate how well that teaching community working in higher education institutions in Tamil Nadu, endorses for the open access publishing model. The study elucidates their preferences on open access publishing and their perceptions about the opportunities and threats in open access publishing. Methods: Survey design was used to conduct the study and a structured questionnaire is used to collect data. Convenience sampling method is adopted for the study. Data collected were organized in Excel and analyzed by using SPSS PASW 18. Cronbach's alpha is used to check the internal reliability of the opportunity and threats items. Frequencies and percentages were used to identify the popular publishing model, opportunity and threat. ANOVA and t-test were used to check the statistical relationship between variables. Results: A total of 121 teaching staffs from five higher education institutions in Tamil Nadu were enrolled in the study. Majority of the prefer Open Access publishing model over the other commercial and hybrid publication models. Around 66.1% of teaching staff responded that Open Access is their first choice of publishing. Around 45.5% of teaching staff abide if their subscribed commercial access publisher moves to hybrid access at some point. 51.2% of teaching abide if their subscribed commercial access publisher moves to complete open access at some point. The top most opportunity item as denoted by the teaching staff was New database of information are emerging and in development (71.1%). The top three threat items as denoted by the teaching staff was Open Access is still evolving to become sustainable (66.1%). Opportunity has a significant statistical relationship with No. of OA Journals publications.

When these charges are included in the calculation, the total cost to institutions as of 2013/14 is around 18.5% over and above the cost of journal subscriptions11% from APCs, 5.5% from indirect costs, and 2% from other publication charges. For the British academic sector as a whole, this represents a total cost of publication around 213 pound million against a conservatively estimated journal spend of 180 pound million, with non-APC publication charges representing around 3.6 pound million. A case study is presented to show that these costs may be unexpectedly high for individual institutions, depending on disciplinary focus.

Further, the aforementioned bibliometrics were examined in relation to country of publisher, as well as their national income threshold. The results of this study provide evidence that bibliometric values such as IF, EF, citability, h-index, and journal rank all increase as APC increases, and each of these metrics are higher in publishers from high-income countries in comparison to upper-middle and lower-middle income countries.

The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected from among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis was performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals were then compared between-group, according to the presence of article processing charges. A within-group analysis was performed on the journals requesting article processing charges from authors, in order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data and the existing literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals.

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on an online questionnaire sent to all the Croatian research and academic libraries. Online questionnaire was chosen as the most appropriate tool, as the authors wanted it to be anonymous and as quick as possible. Findings: The findings indicate that all the academic librarians in Croatia are aware of the importance of institutional OA repositories. The number of OA repositories in Croatia is rather small, but the librarians are making lots of efforts towards the development of new repositories. Croatian librarians think that the most appropriate software is open-source software; that OA repositories have to be open access initiative protocol for metadata harvesting compliant; that copyright owner's consent for archiving is necessary. The biggest problems are the lack of administration support and the researchers' unawareness of the benefits of OA, especially OA repositories. Practical implications: Based on this research, some steps regarding OA could be done on a national level, e. g. guidelines for establishing OA repositories could be created and the obligation of self-archiving should be regulated. This research could be a valuable tool for developing new OA repositories.

1000,WOS,clemens_bluemel,Landscapes of Research: Perceptions of Open Access (OA) Publishing in the Arts and Humanities,open access academic publishing; humanities; social sciences; institutional repositories; Australia,"It is widely known now that scholarly communication is in crisis, resting on an academic publishing model that is unsustainable. One response to this crisis has been the emergence of Open Access (OA) publishing, bringing scholarly literature out from behind a paywall and making it freely available to anyone online. Many research and academic libraries are facilitating the change to OA by establishing institutional repositories, supporting OA policies, and hosting OA journals. In addition, research funding bodies, such as the Australian Research Council (ARC), are mandating that all published grant research outputs be made available in OA, unless legal and contractual obligations prevent this. Despite these broader changes, not all scholars are aware of the new publishing environment. In particular, the rate of adoption of OA models in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) has historically been lower than Science, Technology and Medicine (STM) disciplines. Nevertheless, some local and international OA exemplars exist in HSS. At Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, the faculty-administered environmental humanities journal, Landscapes, was migrated to the institutional open access repository in 2013. Subsequently, researchers in the Faculty of Education and Arts were surveyed regarding their knowledge, understandings, and perceptions of OA publishing. The survey was also designed to elicit the barriers to OA publishing perceived or experienced by HSS researchers. This article will present the findings of our small faculty-based OA survey, with particular attention to HSS academics (and within this subject group, particular attention to the arts and humanities), their perceptions of OA, and the impediments they encounter. We argue that OA publishing will continue to transform scholarship within the arts and humanities, especially through the role of institutional repositories.

1009,WOS,clemens_bluemel,A lost dimension in the open scholarly world: Authors' experiences and open access publishing,0,"The movement of free accessibility of scholarly literature on the public Web has brought uprising in the intellectual class of the digital world. Though several studies have been carried out to understand the end-users' awareness level and the benefits they avail from this revolution, researchers/authors who play a pivotal role and without whom Open Access (OA) could not have seen the dawn and could not have been successful so far, have remained least studied, if not, unnoticed. Regardless of the use of OA platforms, earlier research has to some extent indicated the experiences, behaviour, and attitudes of authors towards open access. The way they think about OA has been explored by authorities from various dimensions. The current chapter is an attempt to understand their experiences, perceptions, and the opinions they hold about open access publishing. The chapter highlights the growing awareness, views, and perceptions of 336 authors in the field of medicine towards OA publishing. The survey instrument, an online questionnaire covering e-mail invitation to participate, was sent to the authors publishing their works in OA journals. The authors who had made recent submissions in the open access journals were consulted and the journals were selected from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The study explores the attitudes of authors to open publishing models, including OA journals and OA repositories. The research work is not a reflection of all the authors in the field of medicine, and hence, the findings should not be generalized to represent the views of all the authors contributing to open access platforms in the field of medicine. Neither should the findings be generalized to represent the views of all the authors in the open access world. The study can further be extended to divulge the views of authors in the field of medicine on the basis of geographical locations and gender. A follow up study can also be taken to monitor the opinion shifts of the authors in the sub-fields of medicine. © 2015, IGI Global.

The changing trends in scholarly publishing processes have revolutionised the academic world. The shifting of academic journals to open access mode has been on the rise because of the numerous benefits associated with it. The high level of profitability reaped from open access titles has forced them to experiment with new and innovative technologies, including Web 2.0. The new shift in the form of Web 2.0 has sifted in to the open access journal world. Open access journals in the field of Agriculture and Food Sciences are growing and so are the features and functionalities within them. Because of these new innovative tools there is an urgent need to focus on their adoption. Design/methodology/approach – Directory of Open Access Journals, being one of the growing open access journal directories, was selected for the purpose of data gathering. The journals selected for the study included those titles which were currently active. Findings – The open access journal landscape in the field of Agriculture and Food Sciences is influenced by the Web 2.0 revolution. The degree of experimenting with Web 2.0 in open access journals in Agriculture and Food Sciences is evident and can prove an excellent platform for the dissemination of agricultural information in a more advanced mode. Researchlimitations/implications – The study will be helpful for journal administrators who belong to the field of Agriculture and Food Sciences to know the actual status of Web 2.0 adoption by the journals in their field. The study can also be helpful for journal administrators for the adoption of Web 2.0 tools to achieve a better, more innovative and interactive scholarly platform. It will also enable us to know how the new pioneering technology – Web 2.0 – can help to explore new innovative ways of managing information in the scholarly world in general and the Agriculture and Food Sciences discipline in particular. Originality/value – The study can be extended to harness the effects of Web 2.0 on the research activities of the scholars associated with various disciplines of Agriculture and Food Sciences. How Agricultural scientists make use of Web 2.0 for sharing and exchange of information for their academic development can also be researched.

The purpose of this study is to trace the status and characteristics of OAJs published across the globe. Various trends that have evolved in OAJ market have been studied. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on data collected from one of the largest OA journal directory - Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The data were downloaded on 02 January 2018 and details of OAJs added to DOAJ till 31 December 2018 were harvested, codified and further analyzed in SPSS software. A Microsoft-Excel template application - MAKESENS - developed by Finnish Meteorological Institute (Finland) in 2002, was explored to perform Mann-Kendall Test and Sen's Slope Estimates. Findings A less score of OAJs offer access to their archival content. An increasing trend is witnessed in the OAJ publishing with Elsevier, Sciendo and BioMed Central (BMC) as the top publishers. Majority of publishers are from high-income zone countries, followed by upper-middle and lower-middle zone countries. Majority of OA publishers are from the UK, Indonesia and Brazil. A lesser score of journals offer article processing charges and/or author submission charges. Majority of OAJs from high- and lower-middle-income zone countries levy submission/processing charge to authors compared to OA journals from upper-middle- and lower-income zone countries (p < 0.01). OJS stays a prioritized platform for hosting OA journal content. Portico and CLOCKSS/LOCKSS are mostly used for long-term preservation purposes. Majority of OAJs from high-income zone countries participate in digital arching initiatives compared to ones from other income zones. Majority of the journals adopt a peer review (double-blind peer review, blind peer review, peer review and open peer review) process for validation of their scholarly content. The time lag between submission and publication ranges from one to 53 weeks, with majority of OAJs having a time lag of 11-20 weeks. Creative Commons Licenses are mainly adopted by OAJs. Research limitations/implications - As the study is based on the data offered by DOAJ, any gaps in the DOAJ data will also get reflected in the study.

The study is an attempt to highlight the relationship between personality traits of authors and OA mode of publishing. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on the responses of 48 faculty members affiliated with different Departments of Science Discipline of University of Kashmir. Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness to experience) were tapped through ten-item personality inventory, and information regarding OA was gauged through six self-devised statements. Findings Pearson correlation test confirms statistically significant relation between personality traits and different dimensions of OA mode of publishing. Personality traits are found to have an influence on author's perception of OA mode of publishing. However, the study could not ascertain any relation between the notions of an author about the quality of OA content with any of the personality traits. Emotionally stable authors are found to explicitly submit their work in OA journals without any anxiety or negativity. Agreeable and conscientious authors also prefer to keep their work open to make it helpful to the broader audience and get maximum recognition from peers and citations to their work respectively. However, some authors (agreeable) hesitate in submitting their work in open platforms due to the fear of getting their works easily copied.

The purpose of this paper is to report the survey's findings. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on data collected from scholars belonging to the Science and Social Science faculties at the University of Kashmir. A pre-defined, closed-ended, 14-item questionnaire was distributed among 84 research scholars. The selection of scholars was based on stratified disproportionate sampling in which the sample size for the departments of both faculties was confined to four scholars, as only four research scholars were enrolled in the Department of Psychology. Findings The majority of the scholars consulted both open access as well as library-subscribed resources. Of OA resource users, four-fifths consulted journals and two-fifths consulted books. Colleagues (57.14 per cent) were the main referral sources of OA awareness with the least intervention from library professionals. Scholars (95.23 per cent) retrieved OA content via search engines. About 21 per cent remarked above 60 per cent relevancy of OA content related to their research need. The majority of scholars considered OA useful to publish their work quickly, boost their productivity as an author and increase citations of their work. One third reported awareness of more than two OA journals. About 30 per cent reported OA journals as a source of publishing their work, whereas just 10 per cent deposited their works in OA repositories. Overall, Science scholars had the edge over their Social Science counterparts in acceptance of open access. Research limitations/implications The research highlights the viewpoints of only 84 scholars out of 326 registered scholars in the fields of Sciences and Social Sciences at the University of Kashmir.

However, true Gold Open Access journals are still outnumbered by traditional journals. Moreover availability of Gold OA journals differs from discipline to discipline and often leaves scientists concerned about the impact of these existent titles. This study identified the current set of Gold Open Access journals featuring a Journal Impact Factor (JIF) by means of Ulrichsweb, Directory of Open Access Journals and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The results were analyzed regarding disciplines, countries, quartiles of the JIF distribution in JCR and publishers. Furthermore the temporal impact evolution was studied for a Top 50 titles list (according to JIF) by means of Journal Impact Factor, SJR and SNIP in the time interval 2000-2010. The identified top Gold Open Access journals proved to be well-established and their impact is generally increasing for all the analyzed indicators. The majority of JCR-indexed OA journals can be assigned to Life Sciences and Medicine. The success-rate for JCR inclusion differs from country to country and is often inversely proportional to the number of national OA journal titles. Compiling a list of JCR-indexed OA journals is a cumbersome task that can only be achieved with non-Thomson Reuters data sources.

It is not always clearly defined how the process of publishing should take place. Information systems architectures are intrinsically complex engineering products that can be defined graphically on various levels of abstractions and represented using different aspects of the system. For that reason enterprise architecture is not easy to comprehend for different actors involved. Graphical representations of different business scenarios are critical to understand how different aspects of the system descriptions are analysed in relation to each other and how requirements from different perspectives are perceived as a whole. The goal of this paper is to introduce the modelling method for visualization of the process of publication of BSc thesis into institutional repositories. Universities need to investigate undergraduate students’ publications of their graduate work (BSc thesis) to promote knowledge of university repositories. Two different modelling methods were used to visualize publishing process and two case studies at two different universities were made. The results indicated and motivated that SICM method had more semantic power to visualize business process in a more comprehensive way. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",a=openaccess,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=university,geo=UGA,,,Gustiené P.,,,,,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,English,Conference Paper,"24th International Conference on Information and Software Technologies, ICIST 2018",4 October 2018 through 6 October 2018,0,,,,,0,Springer Verlag,18650929,9783319999715,2018,920,0,187,197,10.1007/978-3-319-99972-2_15,,,WOS:000438387600004,,2021-01-27

To carry out the sustainability analysis of the Latin American initiative Redalyc.org, based on two fundamental aspects, the economic and the need for its existence. Method. the measurement of the man-hours required to publish a scientific article is carried out, using Marcalyc. 40 articles published in scientific journals from different areas of knowledge, belonging to Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, are processed using this tool. Results. it is obtained that the markup takes on average 86.3% (SD = 4.2%) of the total processing time, distributed in almost equal parts between the content of the article (body) (average = 48.3%, SD = 9.5%) and references, notes, acknowledgement, appendix and glossary (back) (mean = 43.2%, SD = 9.3%). Conclusions. The sustainability of Redalyc's publication model is more economically guaranteed for two reasons; 1) the processing time to generate XML-JATS is much shorter than SciELO, and 2) it uses a markup tool (Marcalyc), which can be used directly by the editorial team of a journal, without the need for specialized technical knowledge. This favors the sustainability of the scientific publication model in Latin American open access and returns the control of the publication process to the editors.",a=openaccess,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=publisher; t=researcher,geo=COL; geo=BRA; geo=MEX; geo=VEN,,,"Guzman-Useche, Eliana; Rodriguez-Contreras, Fernando",,,,J,,BIBLIOS-REVISTA DE BIBLIOTECOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DE LA INFORMACION,Spanish,Article,,,,,"[Guzman-Useche, Eliana; Rodriguez-Contreras, Fernando] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn, Merida, Venezuela",,12,0,"UNIV PITTSBURGH, UNIV LIBRARY SYSTEM",1562-4730,,2019,,76,10,21,10.5195/biblios.2019.588,,,WOS:000438416600007,,2021-01-27

One example of a resource with collaborative content is Wikipedia. Despite the fact that this free encyclopedia is one of the most popular sources of information in the world, it is often criticized for the poor quality of its content. Articles in Wikipedia in different languages on the same topic, can be created and edited independently of each other. Some of these language versions can provide very different but valuable information on each topic. Measuring the quality of articles using metrics is intended to make open data pages such as Wikipedia more reliable and trustworthy. A major challenge is that the 'gold standard' in determining the quality of an open data page is unknown. Therefore, we investigated which factors influence the potentials of quality determination of collaborative open data pages and their sources. Our model is based on empirical data derived from the experience of international experts on knowledge management and data quality. It has been developed by using semi-structured interviews and a qualitative content analysis based on Grounded Theory (GT).

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is descriptive based on the knowledge of a key, player in the development of open access in Sweden. The priorities and outcome of the programme are described. Findings - The paper reveals that the NL Sweden since around 1990 has combined the mission of a traditional national library with that of a national, research library authority. It has coordinated its support for development of repositories and open access in the OpenAccess.se programme that ran from 2006 to 2009. The conclusion is that a national library can successfully act as a catalyst for closer cooperation between the main bodies of research and research libraries in advancing an Open Access agenda and developing a digital research information infrastructure. This is because it is usually placed directly under the government and thus closer to national policy making. It is often perceived as unbiased in relation to the different interests of the various parties involved. It is also able to advance development projects into sustainable services. Originality/value - The role of national libraries in relation to open access has not been discussed widely.

Presents a personal account of the transfer to open access of the leading Canadian journal of sociology. Background: The Canadian Journal of Sociology had established a strong position, internationally, among sociology journals. However, subscriptions were falling as readers increasingly accessed the resource through libraries and a transfer of editorship occasioned an opportunity for a radical reassessment. Rationale for open access: Following something of a personal struggle on the part of the Editor, the rationale for open access, that is, increasing the visibility and use of the journal, was accepted. Support from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council becomes more central to economic viability Conclusion: Converting a scholarly print journal from toll-based to open access cannot be undertaken without serious consideration of all elements of the publishing and editing processes, but the benefits to scholarship are expected to be real. © the authors, 2008.",a=openaccess,m=interview; m=other,d=socscie,t=publisher; t=researcher,geo=CAN,,,Haggerty K.D.,,,,,,Information Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,2,0,13681613,0,2008,13,1,0,0,,,,WOS:000438743500002,,2021-01-27

The substantial resources required by these projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. We extend the use of a method from Jager and Leek to estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a 5-year period using p values from over 30,000 abstracts enabling the study of how the false discovery rate varies by journal characteristics. Results We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer versus general medicine journals (p=9.801E-07, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.097; adjusted mean false discovery rate cancer=0.264 vs. general medicine=0.194). We also find that false discovery rate is negatively associated with log journal impact factor. A two-fold decrease in journal impact factor is associated with an average increase of 0.020 in FDR (p=2.545E-04). Conversely, we find no statistically significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access versus closed access journals (p=0.320, 95% CI -0.015, 0.046, adjusted mean false discovery rate Open Access=0.241 vs. closed access=0.225).Conclusions Our results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science.

The arXiv, for example, is the leading scientific communication platform, mainly for mathematics and physics, where everyone in the world has free access on. While in some scientific disciplines the open access way is successfully realized, other disciplines (e.g. humanities and social sciences) dwell on the traditional path, even though many scientists belonging to these communities approve the open access principle. In this paper we try to explain these different publication patterns by using a game theoretical approach. Based on the assumption, that the main goal of scientists is the maximization of their reputation, we model different possible game settings, namely a zero sum game, the prisoners' dilemma case and a version of the stag hunt game, that show the dilemma of scientists belonging to non-open access communities. From an individual perspective, they have no incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium of traditional publishing. By extending the model using the quantum game theory approach it can be shown, that if the strength of entanglement exceeds a certain value, the scientists will overcome the dilemma and terminate to publish only traditionally in all three settings.

But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data ('analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25% pre-policy to 136/ 174, 78% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/ 104, 22% pre-policy to 85/136, 62%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing.

While open data for society at large is a relatively new phenomenon, the space sector has been accustomed to open data for all of its existence, especially in astronomy and navigation, but also in Earth observation. In the context of the open data debate, the purpose of this paper is to examine 21 policy and legal instruments concerning open data made by a range of organisations that in one way or another relate to Earth observation data and therefore contribute to the critical examination of the effectiveness of the open data movement. Based on these documents, the paper discusses common issues such as changing perspectives on the desirability of open data, commercial use, and licences and exceptions, and concludes that open access to Earth observation data requires more specification in order to clarify the conditions of access and so to realise fully the potential benefits.

Objectives: Summarizing the present situation for journal transformation. Presenting criteria for adequate transformation as well as a specific approach for it. Describing our exemplary implementation of such a journal transformation. Methods: Studying the respective literature as well as discussing this topic in various discussion groups and meetings (primarily of editors and publishers, but also of authors and readers), with long term experience as editors and/or publishers of scientific publications as prerequisite. Results: There is a clear will, particularly of political and funding organizations, towards open access publishing. In spite of this, there is still a large amount of scientific knowledge, being communicated through subscription based journals. For successfully transforming such journals into open access, sixteen criteria for a goal-oriented, stepwise, sustainable, and fair transformation are suggested. The Tandem Model as transformation approach is introduced. Our exemplary implementation is done in the Trans-O-MIM project. It is exploring strategies, models and evaluation metrics for journal transformation. As instance the journal Methods of Information in Medicine will apply the Tandem Model from 2017 onwards. Conclusions: Within Trans-O-MIM we will reach at least nine of the sixteen criteria for adequate transformation. It was positive to implement Trans-O-MIM as international research project.

Subjects: A total of 21 open access LIS journals identified via the Directory of Open Access Journals that were actively publishing, and that also met the authors' standard of scholarliness, which they established by identifying a journal's peer-review process or other evidence of rigorous review. Based on responses, 12 journals published using discrete issues, while 9 published as rolling volumes or as rolling volumes with some discrete issues. Methods: In late 2011, the study's authors invited lead editors or primary journal contacts to complete the survey. Survey participants were asked to identify whether their journal published in discrete issues, rolling volumes, or rolling volumes with occasional discrete issues, with the latter two categories combined as one for ease of results analysis. Survey logic split respondents into two groups, either discrete-issue or rolling-volume. Respondents in both categories were posed similar sets of questions, with the key difference being that the questions directed at each category accounted for the publication model the journals themselves identified as using. Editors from both groups were asked about the reasons for using the publication model they identified for their journal: within the survey tool, authors provided 16 potential reasons for using a discrete-issue model, and 13 potential reasons for using a rolling-volume model. Respondents from both groups were asked to mark all reasons that applied for their respective journals. The survey also included questions about whether the journal had ever used the alternate publishing model, the editor's satisfaction with their current model, and the likelihood of the journal switching to the alternate publishing model in the foreseeable future. Main Results: The authors collected complete responses from 21 of the original 29 journals invited to participate in the study, a response rate of 72%. For the 12 journals that identified as using discrete issues, ease of production workflow (91.7%), clear production deadlines (75.0%), and journal publicity and promotion (75.0%) were the three most common reasons for using a discrete-issue model. For the nine journals using rolling volumes, improved production workflow (77.8%), decreased dependence on production deadlines (77.8%), and increased speed of research dissemination (66.7%) were the three most common reasons cited for using a rolling-volume model. Findings show that overall satisfaction with a journal's particular publication model was a common factor regardless of publishing model in use, though only the rolling-volume editors unanimously reported being very satisfied with their model. This high satisfaction rate is reflected in editors' positions that they were very unlikely to switch away from the rolling-volume method. While a majority of editors of discrete-issue journals also reported being very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their current model, the mixed responses to whether they would contemplate switching to the alternate model suggests that awareness of the benefits of rolling-volume publishing is increasing. Conclusion: Researchers discovered a greater incidence of rolling-volume model journals with open access LIS journals than anticipated, suggesting that this is an area where additional research is necessary. The relative newness of the rolling-volume model may be a contributing factor to the high satisfaction rate among editors of journals using this model, as journal editors are likely to be more deliberate in selecting this model over the traditional discrete-issue publishing model. Workflow and production practices were identified as key chareristics for selecting a publishing model regardless of the model selected, and therefore this is another area in need of further investigation. © 2014 Hayman.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=socscie (LIS),t=librarians; t=researcher; t=publisher,geo=USA,2011,,Hayman R.,,,,,,Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,0,University of Alberta,1715720X,0,2014,9,3,83,85,10.18438/b8v89p,,,WOS:000447007300004,,2021-01-27
1082,WOS,clemens_bluemel,Some LIS Faculty Indicate Reservations about Open Access,,"Objective - To examine the awareness of, attitudes toward, and engagement with open access (OA) publishing, based on rank and tenure status among library and information science (LIS) faculty in North America. Design - Web-based survey distributed via email. Setting - Accredited library and information science (LIS) programs in North America. Subjects - 276 professors and professors emeriti. Methods - Researchers collected email addresses for 1,017 tenure-track, tenured, and emeriti professors from the public websites of the LIS programs. Researchers sent an email invitation to participate in the survey by accessing a URL, with the survey itself delivered using Qualtrics software. The survey included 51 total questions, some with additional sub-questions, and most items used Likert-type rating scale. The researchers analysed the data using SPSS software, and indicated using chi-square tests to measure significance, with a stated intent to get beyond the descriptive statistics commonly seen in other publications. Main Results - This study's results draw on 276 completed responses, for a response rate of 27%. Researchers reported that 53% of respondents had some experience with publishing in a peer-reviewed OA format. When asked whether they agreed that scholarly articles should be free to access for everyone, pre-tenure assistant professors were most likely to agree (74%), followed by tenured associate professors (62%), full professors (59%) and then emeriti professors (8%). However, they found less likelihood that associate professors would have actually published in an OA format, highlighting a disconnect between beliefs about accessibility of research and actual practice with open access (p. 646). Researchers also discovered a connection between faculty awareness of institutional and disciplinary repositories and faculty publishing in OA journals, though a relatively low number (35%) had deposited their output in a repository within the previous year. That increases to 50% of respondents when timeframe is ignored. Faculty who had never published in OA journals ranked several barriers to doing so, barriers common across disciplinary boundaries. These include objections to paying OA fees; perceptions of slow time to publish, low research impact, and venue prestige when compared to traditional subscription journals; an inability to identify an appropriate OA journal; and an inability to pay OA fees. However, the researchers note that a majority of these respondents who had never published in an OA format would do so if these barriers were removed. Those participants who had some previous experience with OA were more likely to have positive perceptions of OA journal quality and impact, as well as the overall publishing experience, as compared to publishing in traditional journals. As in other disciplines, LIS faculty are conscious of the connection between OA and tenure and promotion processes. For example, this study reveals that non-tenured faculty are more likely to agree that publishing in OA venues may affect their career progress. Researchers report uncertainty about OA even among tenured LIS faculty. Of all respondents, only 34% agreed that a tenure or promotion committee might consider an OA publication on par with a traditional publication, while 44% of respondents were of the opinion that an OA publication would be treated less favourably than a traditional journal. A mere 1% of respondents believed that an OA publication would be treated more favourably within the tenure and promotion process. Despite this unfavourable perception of OA, the researchers report that 38% of respondents planned to publish in an OA journal regardless of whether their tenure and promotion committees might treat that OA publication unfavourably. Conclusion - The researchers report a connection between publishing in an OA journal and academic rank, with full professors more likely to publish OA or to have previous experience in publishing in an OA journal as compared to assistant professor colleagues, who perceive publishing in OA as a potential impediment to career progress. The researchers note that there is significant opportunity for LIS faculty involved in tenure and promotion committees to consider and clarify how OA publications are treated, and the impact of OA publishing with regard to career progress. Moreover, given the levels of uncertainty and equivocacy among faculty respondents as a whole regarding certain aspects of OA, the perceptions around quality and rigour, there is room for further research into LIS professors' perceptions and attitudes toward open access, and how these change over time.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=socscie (LIS),t=researcher,geo=USA; geo=CAN,,,"Hayman, Richard",,,,J,,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,English,Article,,,,,"[Hayman, Richard] Mt Royal Univ, Calgary, AB, Canada",,2,0,UNIV ALBERTA,1715-720X,,2016,11,3,96,98,10.18438/B8890B,,,WOS:000447007300007,,2021-01-27
1083,WOS,clemens_bluemel,"LIS Practitioner-focused Research Trends Toward Open Access Journals, Academic-focused Research Toward Traditional Journals",,"Objective To examine the occupational characteristics and publication habits of library and information science (LIS) authors regarding traditional journals and open access journals. Design Content analysis. Setting English language research articles published in open access (OA) journals and non-open access (non-OA) journals from 2008 to 2013 that are indexed in LIS databases. Subjects The authorship characteristics for 3,472 peer-reviewed articles. Methods This researcher identified 33 total journals meeting the inclusion criteria by using the LIS categories within 2012 Journal Citation Reports (JCR) to find 13 appropriate non-OA journals, and within the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) to identify 20 appropriate OA journals. They found 1,665 articles by 3,186 authors published in the non OA journals, and another 1,807 articles by 3,446 authors within the OA journals. The researcher used author affiliation to determine article authors' occupations using information included in the articles themselves or by looking for information on the Internet, and excluded articles when occupational information could not be located. Authors were categorized into four occupational categories: Librarians (practitioners), Academics (faculty and researchers), Students (graduate or undergraduate), and Others. Using these categories, the author identified 10 different types of collaborations for coauthored articles. Main Results This research involves three primary research questions. The first examined the occupational differences between authors publishing in OA journals versus non-OA journals. Academics (faculty and researchers) more commonly published in non-OA journals (58.1%) compared to OA journals (35.6%). The inverse was true for librarian practitioners, who were more likely to publish in OA journals (53.9%) compared to non-OA journals (25.5%). Student authors, a combined category that included both graduate and undergraduate students, published more in non-OA journals (10.1%) versus in OA journals (5.0%). The final category of other saw only a slight difference between non-OA (6.3%) and OA (5.5%) publication venues. This second research question explored the difference in the proportion of LIS authors who published in OA and non-OA journals. Overall, authors were more likely to publish in OA journals (72.4%) vs. non-OA (64.3%). Librarians tended to be primary authors in OA journals, while LIS academics tend to be primary authors for articles in non-OA publications. Academics from outside the LIS discipline but contributing to the disciplinary literature were more likely to publish in non OA journals. Regarding trends over time, this research showed a decrease in the percentage of librarian practitioners and other authors publishing in OA journals, while academics and students increased their OA contributions rates during the same period. Finally, the research explored whether authors formed different types of collaborations when publishing in OA journals as compared to non OA journals. When examining co-authorship of articles, just over half of all articles published in OA journals (54.4%) and non-OA journals (53.2%) were co-authored. Overall the researcher identified 10 types of collaborative relationships and examined the rates for publishing in OA versus non-OA journals for these relationships. OA journals saw three main relationships, with high levels of collaborations between practitioner librarians (38.6% of collaborations), between librarians and academics (20.5%), and between academics only (18.0%). Non-OA journals saw four main relationships, with collaborations between academics appearing most often (34.1%), along with academic-student collaborations (21.5%), practitioner librarian collaborations (15.5%), and librarian-academic collaborations (13.2%). Conclusion LIS practitioner-focused research tends to appear more often in open access journals, while academic-focused researcher tends to appear more often in non-OA journals. These trends also appear in research collaborations, with co-authored works involving librarians appearing more often in OA journals, and collaborations that include academics more likely to appear in non-OA journals.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=socscie (LIS),t=researcher; t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,2008-2013,,"Hayman, Richard",,,,J,,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,English,Article,,,,,"[Hayman, Richard] Mt Royal Univ, Calgary, AB, Canada",,1,0,UNIV ALBERTA,1715-720X,,2018,13,1,24,26,10.18438/eblip29377,,,WOS:000447517500008,,2021-01-27

There is currently less discussion on open science and its influence on learning and teaching in higher education, and reversely. This paper discusses open science in relation to educational practices and resources and reports on a study to investigate current educational practices from the perspective of open science. We argue that offering students opportunities via open educational practices raises their awareness of future open science goals and teaches them the skills needed to reach those goals. We present online survey results from 210 participants with teaching responsibility at higher education institutions in Germany. While some of them try to establish more open learning and teaching settings, most respondents apply rather traditional ways of learning and teaching. 60% do not use open educational resources - many have not even heard of them - nor do they make their courses open for an online audience. Participants' priority lies in resource accuracy and quality and we still see a gap between the benefit of open practices and their practicability and applicability.

The approach is domain specific and was based on a framework of theories on intellectual and social organization of the sciences and communication practices in the digital era. In the study we apply a theoretical model of user acceptance and user behavior (UTAUT) developed by Venkatesh et al. in 2003 as an explanatory model for developing a survey form for a quantitative empirical research on user attitudes and preferences. Thus our research approach is new and crossdisciplinary in the way we combine earlier research results from the fields of organizational theory, information science and information systems science.

We show that nonselective megajournals have started to decline in all bibliometric parameters. These journals in particular have lost connection with the most advanced science as revealed by the decreasing citations to and from the top-tier journals. While some megajournals have underperformed on bibliometric parameters from the beginning of their existence, others experienced a short honeymoon period before declining. In contrast, major discipline-specific open-access journals remain competitive, and those published by less prominent publishers have even increased their performance. However, the discipline-specific open-access journals also display decreasing citations to and from the top-tier journals.

Based on an analysis of the content of the web pages of the journals and the application of a survey to their editors, the access and publication formats, use of journal management systems, Creative Commons licenses, copyright policies, use of plagiarism detection software and financing models are examined in detail. The results show that all academic journals in the field of urbanism, architecture, design and art in Chile are published by nonprofit universities, and declare themselves as “open access”, with their articles being available free of charge through their web pages, institutional repositories and/or SciELO, Latindex and RedALyC. Likewise, most of the journals use Creative Commons licenses and recently the Open Journal System. However, more than half of the journals still use restrictive copyrights or do not have explicit editorial policies in this regard, which limits the open access of their manuscripts. Other problems for the open access are the lack of “sustainable financing models” and the preference of Latin American authors for publishing in high impact international journals in English, usually edited by commercial publishers without open access. These problems are important challenges that require new editorial strategies, in order to ensure that high-quality Latin American research is available in an open access format to the entire academic community. © 2018, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

However, if developing countries do not improve their capacity for research and development (R&D) in the field, they might be left out of the genomics revolution. Large-scale and widely accessible databases for storing and analyzing genomic data are crucial tools for the advancement of genomic medicine. Building developing countries' capacity in genomics is accordingly closely linked to their involvement in international human genomics research initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a pilot study on the impact of international open science genomics projects on capacity building in R&D in developing countries. Using indicators we developed in previous work to measure the performance of international open science genomics projects, we analyse the policies and practices of four key projects in the field: the International HapMap Project, the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative, the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network and the Structural Genomics Consortium. The results show that these projects play an important role in genomics capacity building in developing countries, but play a more limited role with regard to the potential redistribution of the benefits of research to the populations of these countries. We further suggest concrete initiatives that could facilitate the involvement of researchers from developing countries in the international genomics research community and accelerate capacity building in the developing world.",a=openmethod; a=opendata; a=openevaluation,m=document review; m=other,d=natscie; d=med,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,check whether to introduce new country groups (StS),,"Hetu, Martin; Koutouki, Konstantia; Joly, Yann",,,,J,,FRONTIERS IN GENETICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Hetu, Martin; Joly, Yann] McGill Univ, Ctr Genom & Policy, Fac Med, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Koutouki, Konstantia] Univ Montreal, Fac Law, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,48,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,2019,10,,,,10.3389/fgene.2019.00095,,,WOS:000452288900013,30828348,2021-01-27

This paper aims to advance a conceptualization of citizen participation and investigates its effect on open data use at the municipal level. Design/methodology/approach: Based on 14 semi-structured interviews with citizens involved in open data projects within the city of Montréal (Canada), the paper develops a research model linking the multidimensional construct of citizen participation with initial use of open data in municipalities. Findings: The study shows that citizen participation is a key contributor to the use of open data through four distinct categories of participation, namely, hands-on activities, greater responsibility, better communication and improved relations between citizens and the open data portal development team. While electronic government research often views open data implementation as a top-down project, the current study demonstrates that citizens are central to the success of open data initiatives and shows how their role can be effectively leveraged across various dimensions of participation. Originality/value: This paper proposes a conceptualization of citizen participation on open data use at the municipal level. Citizen participation is a found to be a key contributor to the use of open data through four distinct categories of participation, namely, hands-on activities, greater responsibility, better communication and improved relations between citizens and the open data portal development team.

1142,WOS,clemens_bluemel,Participatory design for ontologies: A case study of an open science ontology for qualitative coding schemas,Ontology engineering; Participatory design; Digital humanities; Semantic web; Open science; Qualitative research; Coding schemas,"Purpose The open science movement calls for transparent and retraceable research processes. While infrastructures to support these practices in qualitative research are lacking, the design needs to consider different approaches and workflows. The paper bases on the definition of ontologies as shared conceptualizations of knowledge (Borst, 1999). The authors argue that participatory design is a good way to create these shared conceptualizations by giving domain experts and future users a voice in the design process via interviews, workshops and observations. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a novel approach for creating ontologies in the field of open science using participatory design. As a case study the creation of an ontology for qualitative coding schemas is presented. Coding schemas are an important result of qualitative research, and reuse can yield great potential for open science making qualitative research more transparent, enhance sharing of coding schemas and teaching of qualitative methods. The participatory design process consisted of three parts: a requirement analysis using interviews and an observation, a design phase accompanied by interviews and an evaluation phase based on user tests as well as interviews. Findings The research showed several positive outcomes due to participatory design: higher commitment of users, mutual learning, high quality feedback and better quality of the ontology. However, there are two obstacles in this approach: First, contradictive answers by the interviewees, which needs to be balanced; second, this approach takes more time due to interview planning and analysis. Practical implications The implication of the paper is in the long run to decentralize the design of open science infrastructures and to involve parties affected on several levels. Originality/value In ontology design, several methods exist by using user-centered design or participatory design doing workshops. In this paper, the authors outline the potentials for participatory design using mainly interviews in creating an ontology for open science. The authors focus on close contact to researchers in order to build the ontology upon the expert's knowledge.",a=openmethod,m=interview; m=other,d=engtech; d=hum; d=socscie,t=researcher; t=practitioner,geo=DEU,,,"Hocker, Julian; Schindler, Christoph; Rittberger, Marc",,,,J,,ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,English,Article,,,,,"[Hocker, Julian; Schindler, Christoph; Rittberger, Marc] DIPF Leibniz Inst Res & Informat Educ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hocker, Julian] Univ Hildesheim, Dept Informat Sci & Nat Language Proc, Hildesheim, Germany; [Rittberger, Marc] Darmstadt Univ Appl Sci, Darmstadt, Germany",,37,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2050-3806,,2020,72,4,671,685,10.1108/AJIM-11-2019-0320,,,WOS:000454147800001,,2021-01-27

The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers' institutions.

An investigation of the research output of Finnish universities,Open access; Altmetrics; Journals; Open access advantage; Gold OA,"Scientific articles available in Open Access (OA) have been found to attract more citations and online attention to the extent that it has become common to speak about OA Altmetrics Advantage. This research investigates how the OA Altmetrics Advantage holds for a specific case of research articles, namely the research outputs from universities in Finland. Furthermore, this research examines disciplinary and platform specific differences in that (dis)advantage. The new methodological approaches developed in this research focus on relative visibility, i.e. how often articles in OA journals receive at least one mention on the investigated online platforms, and relative receptivity, i.e. how frequently articles in OA journals gain mentions in comparison to articles in subscription-based journals. The results show significant disciplinary and platform specific differences in the OA advantage, with articles in OA journals within for instance veterinary sciences, social and economic geography and psychology receiving more citations and attention on social media platforms, while the opposite was found for articles in OA journals within medicine and health sciences. The results strongly support field- and platform-specific considerations when assessing the influence of journal OA status on altmetrics.

We conducted this cross-sectional study to determine the current share and provision methods of OA in the field of oncology, identify predictors of OA status (OA versus non-OA), and study the association between OA and citation counts. Materials and methods: PubMed was searched for oncology-related, peer-reviewed journal articles published in December 2014. Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, OpenDOAR and OAIster were manually checked to assess the OA status of each included article. Citation data were extracted from Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the OA proportion (primary outcome) and OA provision methods. Multivariable logistic regression and multilevel generalized linear model analyses were performed to study predictors of OA status and the association between OA and citation counts, respectively. Results: In a random sample of 1000 articles, 912 were deemed eligible and therefore included. Of these, the full-texts of 530 articles (58.1%; 95% CI: 54.9-61.3) were freely available online: 314 (34.4%) were available from publishers ('Gold road' to OA), 424 (46.5%) were available via self-archiving ('Green road' to OA). According to multivariable regression analyses, impact factor, publisher type, language, research type, number of authors, continent of origin, and country income were significant predictors of articles' OA status; OA articles received a citation rate 1.24 times the incidence rate for non-OA articles (95% CI: 1.05-1.47; P = 0.012). Conclusions: Based on our sample, in the field of oncology, 42% of recent journal articles are behind the pay-wall (non-OA) 1 year after publication; the 'Green road' of providing OA is more common than the 'Gold road'; OA is associated with higher citation counts.",a=openacces,m=biblio,d=med,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Hua, F.; Sun, H.; Walsh, T.; Glenny, A. -M.; Worthington, H.",,,,J,,ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Hua, F.; Walsh, T.; Glenny, A. -M.; Worthington, H.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Cochrane Oral Hlth, Div Dent,Sch Med Sci,Fac Biol Med & Hlth, JR Moore Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Sun, H.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Mol & Clin Canc Sci, Sch Med Sci,Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Manchester, Lancs, England",,35,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,0923-7534,,2017,28,10,2612,2617,10.1093/annonc/mdx398,,,WOS:000456829000002,28961842,2021-01-27

The bibliometric analysis was carried out for the array of Russian papers published in the journals of the Gold Open Access system and reflected in the SCI-E database for 2008-2017. The results of the analysis of the publication activity showed that, despite the high payments for papers, there was a steady increase in the share of Russian publications in such journals compared to the overall publication activity of Russia: from 7.8% in 2008 to 13.7% in 2017. This is largely due to active international cooperation of Russian organizations with funding agencies from the United States (31%), Germany (29%), and other industrialized countries. Analysis of the array of Gold OA publications in large research areas made it possible to establish a significant difference in its structure compared to the general array of publications in Russia.

This study contributes to the evolving empirical basis for funding these charges and examines how much German universities and research organisations spent on open access publication fees. Using self-reported cost data from the Open APC initiative, the analysis focused on the amount that was being spent on publication fees, and compared these expenditure with data from related Austrian (FWF) and UK (Wellcome Trust, Jisc) initiatives, in terms of both size and the proportion of articles being published in fully and hybrid open access journals. We also investigated how thoroughly self-reported articles were indexed in Crossref, a DOI minting agency for scholarly literature, and analysed how the institutional spending was distributed across publishers and journal titles. According to self-reported data from 30 German universities and research organisations between 2005 and 2015, expenditures on open access publication fees increased over the years in Germany and amounted to 9,627,537 for 7,417 open access journal articles. The average payment was 1,298, and the median was is an element of 1,231. A total of 94% of the total article volume included in the study was supported in accordance with the price cap of 2,000, a limit imposed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of its funding activities for open access funding at German universities. Expenditures varied considerably at the institutional level. There were also differences in how much the institutions spent per journal and publisher. These differences reflect, at least in part, the varying pricing schemes in place including discounted publication fees. With journals articles indexing coverage of 99%, Crossref thoroughly indexed the open access articles included in the study. A comparison with the related openly available cost data from Austria and the UK revealed that German universities and research organisations primarily funded articles in fully open access journals. By contrast, articles in hybrid journal accounted for the largest share of spending according to the Austrian and UK data. Fees paid for hybrid journals were on average more expensive than those paid for fully open access journals.",a=openacces,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=DEU,,,"Jahn, Najko; Tullney, Marco",,,,J,,PEERJ,English,Article,,,,,"[Jahn, Najko] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld Univ Lib, Bielefeld, Germany; [Tullney, Marco] German Natl Lib Sci & Technol TIB, Hannover, Germany",,41,13,PEERJ INC,2167-8359,,2016,4,,,,10.7717/peerj.2323,,,WOS:000468340400001,27602289,2021-01-27

To support evidence-generation at the rapid pace required in a pandemic, LEOSS follows an Open Science approach, making data available to the public in real-time. To protect patient privacy, quantitative anonymization procedures are used to protect the continuously published data stream consisting of 16 variables on the course and therapy of COVID-19 from singling out, inference and linkage attacks. We investigated the bias introduced by this process and found that it has very little impact on the quality of output data. Current laws do not specify requirements for the application of formal anonymization methods, there is a lack of guidelines with clear recommendations and few real-world applications of quantitative anonymization procedures have been described in the literature.

We address this requirement with a methodology that we developed and tested for France, but that could be extended to other countries. Only open data and information available on the Web are used, leveraging as much as we can large-scale systems such as Unpaywall, HAL (the main open repository in France, part of the CNRS), ORCID and IDRef (referential for French Higher Education and Research). We used rule-based and machine learning techniques to enrich the metadata of the publications. We estimate that the overall OA rate for French affiliated publications ranges from 39% to 42% between 2013 and 2017. The trend is slightly up, except for the last year, but we gather evidence that shows this is a consequence of the moving nature of the OA status. Therefore these figures should be seen as a snapshot rather than definitive. For the last observed year (2017), we show that the OA rate varies according to the publication type, the publisher and the discipline (more than 60% in Mathematics while it is about 30% in Medical research which represents the largest share in the number of publications). We describe the main challenges of our method (detection of the publications with a French affiliation, metadata enrichment with machine learning, open access status) and evaluate the errors of each step. Most of the method is not country-specific and could be applied for another perimeter.

In November 2008, medical journals from Korea began to be added to PubMed Central (PMC). Therefore, it would be interesting to know whether or not their impact factor based on Web of Science has increased since the journals were listed in PMC/PubMed. To answer this question, a citation analysis of seven journals that have been indexed in PMC since 2008 or 2009 was done. Only non-Medline journals were selected and the impact factors of five Medline journals were compared. The impact factor was calculated via Web of Science. Journal Citation Reports (JCR) data were used if the data of the target journals were provided in JCR. Trends for the impact factors of different years were analyzed using dBSTAT ver. 5.0. There has been an increasing rates of the impact factor for the seven non-Medline journals, 1.92 in 2011 over 2010; 3.27 in 2010 over 2009; 1.12 in 2012 over 2011. As for the five Medline journals, the increasing rate in 2010 over 2009 was 1.18; however, those of 2011 over 2010 and 2012 over 2011 were 1.01 and 1.04 respectively. The Science Citation Index Expanded impact factor of medical journals published in Korea can be increased if those journals are published in English and listed in PMC.

It details a qualitative semi-structured interview data capture approach with many institutionally based OA practitioners, which provided a narrative picture of academic and institutional responses to emerging OA dissemination paradigms. Through an analytical process incorporating qualitative content analysis and ideological critique, it focuses on practitioner perceptions of the types and configuration of barriers between scholars and a greater cultural adoption of OA practices. While the greatest problems perceived relate to academic intellectual disengagement or indifference to publishing praxis change, no singular cause of resistance was identified. The study reveals practitioners' perceptions of a multiplicity of operational, technological and ideological barriers blocking progress, and consequently a picture of academic engagement remaining disappointingly patchy. Moreover, moves to increase scholarly compliance through allying it to modalities of fiscal income and metrics, while potentially enhancing practical compliance, appear to risk distorting any revolutionary configuration of OA practices.",a=openacces,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=practitioner,geo=GBR,,,"Johnson, Gareth J.",,,,J,,INSIGHTS-THE UKSG JOURNAL,English,Article,,,,,"[Johnson, Gareth J.] Univ Warwick, Inst Adv Study, Coventry, W Midlands, England",,26,3,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,2048-7754,,2018,31,,,,10.1629/uksg.400,,,WOS:000472587500010,,2021-01-27

An electronic survey with closed- and open-ended questions was used to collect data, which were analyzed for recurring themes. Of respondents whose campuses did observe OA Week, the most reported reason for doing so was related to supporting the library's educational outreach program; fewer respondents cited the library's philosophical commitment to open access. Lack of time was the most frequently given reason for OA Week non-participation, however around one quarter of non-participating respondents reported that they were unaware of OA Week, and another quarter reported that it did not figure in their strategic plan. The conditions that were found to best support celebrating OA Week included a grasp of the principles guiding OA on the part of at least one librarian, reinforced by: the educational mission of the library; adequate personnel; and sufficient time for planning.

This paper provides an early review of administrative costs incurred by universities in making research outputs OA, either via publication in journals (Gold OA), involving payment of article-processing charges (APCs), or via deposit in repositories (Green OA). Using data from 29 UK institutions, it finds that the administrative time, as well as the cost incurred by universities, to make an article OA using the Gold route is over 2.5 times higher than Green. Costs are then modeled at a national level using recent UK policy initiatives from Research Councils UK and the Higher Education Funding Councils' Research Excellence Framework as case studies. The study also demonstrates that the costs of complying with research funders' OA policies are considerably higher than where an OA publication is left entirely to authors' discretion.

Analysis across country groups is complemented with analysis across major subject fields. Quartile rankings indicate that journals in Q1 dominate in group A, followed by journals in Q2. In the remaining two country groups, journals belonging to Q3 have more than 50% of the share. Analysis by different scientific fields stresses that life and health sciences have the highest shares of OAJs in Q1. In physical sciences the highest share of OAJs is in Q3 while combined shares of Q2 and Q3 are above 50%. Only 10% of all European OAJs in social sciences is in Q1.

Three previous studies of the Canadian public's opinion about these topics have been conducted. Building on those results, an online survey representing the first study of public perceptions about biobanking spanning all Canadian provinces was conducted. Specifically, this study examined qualitative views about biobank objectives, governance structure, control and ownership of samples and data, benefit sharing, consent practices and data sharing norms, as well as additional questions and ethical concerns expressed by the public. Results Over half the respondents preferred to give a one-time general consent for the future sharing of their samples among researchers. Most expressed willingness for their data to be shared with the international scientific community rather than used by one or more Canadian institutions. Whereas more respondents indicated a preference for one-time general consent than any other model of consent, they constituted less than half of the total responses, revealing a lack of consensus among survey respondents regarding this question. Respondents identified biobank objectives, governance structure and accountability as the most important information to provide participants. Respondents' concerns about biobanking generally centred around the control and ownership of biological samples and data, especially with respect to potential misuse by insurers, the government and other third parties. Although almost half the respondents suggested that these should be managed by the researchers' institutions, results indicate that the public is interested in being well-informed about these projects and suggest the importance of increased involvement from participants.

What are the differences and similarities between the approach to Open Access in the countries of the region? What lies behind these? 2. Have respondents ever had access to Open Access? How do they feel about its advantages or disadvantages? Do they utilize its hidden potentials, or are they still skeptical about it? 3. Have academics seen an increase in the scientific visibility of their work due to open access? Our research results indicate significant differences between the countries of the region, especially as regards student responses. We aimed to find reasons for these differences so as to be able to offer suggestions for further research topics in the field. © 2015 International Institute of Informatics and Systemics IIIS.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a Web-based survey questionnaire, data were collected from full-time faculty members teaching at AAU, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Findings - The study found that faculty members possess a good knowledge and a positive perception of OA resources. They frequently use OA resources for teaching, learning and research activities. However, the findings indicate that female faculty members are more likely to use OA resources than male faculty members. Faculty members with a high level of awareness or use are found to have a highly positive perception of OA resources. Presenting research reports at conferences and seminars or publishing research papers is weakly associated with the level of awareness and use of OA resources. The study revealed no association between the faculty member and their use of OA resources. Research limitations/implications - It is essential for scientific communities to understand the importance of OA resources and how to use them effectively in teaching, learning and research activities. Originality/value - This kind of research is new to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general and the UAE in particular.

While Open Access agreements have been negotiated with a growing number of big publishers, smaller publishers hardly figured in the debates on the Open Access transformation so far. We therefore interviewed representatives of 82 small and medium-sized scholarly publishers about their experiences, attitudes and offers on Open Access. Our survey shows that Open Access is becoming more important for these publishers and their authors, although there are clear differences in attitudes and knowledge regarding Open Access, depending on their size, subject areas, and literature types.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through literature searches, using the internet, journal databases and university websites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for information about OA and IRs in East Africa. Some of the findings were based on the author's PhD The management and accessibility of OA IRs in selected universities in East Africa, which used face-to-face interviews with six librarians and self-administered questionnaires responded to by 183 researchers at Kenyatta University, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Makerere University. Findings - Universities in East Africa were still in the intermediate stages of embracing OA, and only 40 libraries out of 145 universities had implemented IRs. However, most of the repositories had less than 1,000 items, with this challenge attributed to the absence of institutional and government/funder mandates that affected the collection/provision of OA, in addition to the lack of awareness of IRs among researchers.

Together with these technological innovations, the development of alternative methods has become inevitable. Most authors have had difficulty in making decision between open access and the traditional subscription-based journals. In this study we aimed to compare the changes in citation numbers of open access vs. subscription-based journals in Otorhinolaryngology publishing among Turkish authors and institutions. MATERIAL and METHODS In this study we reviewed 28 Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) journals which have matched SCImago journal rank (SJR) values and included a total of 2,000 scientific papers published by Turkish authors between 2010 and 2015. All data extracted from SJR website and Google Scholar system. RESULTS There was statistically significant difference found between the subscription based (SB) and Open access (OA) according to the types of articles (p=0.000). The difference between the mean total cite number per article of SB and OA journals is not statistically significant but close to level of significance (p=0.061) CONCLUSION When choosing between open access and subscription based journals to publish, it is important to consider the journal's visibility, the cost of publication. Open access publishing trend is on the rise among Turkish researchers, though they still mostly prefer the subscription based journals in otorhinolaryngology category.",a=openacces,m=biblio,d=med,t=other,geo=TUR,,,"Kazikdas, Kadir Cagdas; Yalcinozan, Eda Tuna; Tinazli, Remzi; Safakogullari, Hasan; Sancar, Nuriye",,,,J,,CYPRUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES,English,Article,,,,,"[Kazikdas, Kadir Cagdas; Yalcinozan, Eda Tuna; Tinazli, Remzi; Safakogullari, Hasan] Near East Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Sancar, Nuriye] Near East Univ, Dept Math, Sch Art & Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus",,6,0,AVES,2149-7893,,2018,3,3,164,167,10.5152/cjms.2018.634,,,WOS:000485943600003,,2021-01-27

As a study sample, 14 OA journals affiliated to the University of Zürich, Switzerland, were taken. They were very different in nature, ranging from well-established society journals to newly founded titles launched by dedicated individuals. The study comprised two approaches: a comprehensive journal assessment and subsequent editor interviews. The journal assessments evaluated the functionalities, ease of use, sustainability and visibility of the journal. The interviews were used to get additional background information about the journals and explore editors' needs, experiences and viewpoints. The results show that journals affiliated to publishing houses or libraries are technically well provided for. Unaffiliated journals offer fewer functionalities and display some unconventional features, often described as innovations by the editors. More resources-financial or human-is seen by nearly all editors as the most pressing need and as a limitation to growth. In comparison, IT/technical needs are mentioned much less often. The article also describes the launch of an Editors' Forum, an idea suggested by the editors and implemented by the library. This Forum offered further valuable insight into the potential role of libraries, but also specifically addressed several of the editors' needs as expressed in the interviews. © 2015 Alice Keller.",a=openacces,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=CHE,,,Keller A.,,,,,,Insights: the UKSG Journal,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,3,United Kingdom Serials Group,20487754,0,2015,28,3,19,31,10.1629/uksg.256,,,WOS:000486139800004,,2021-01-27

It is argued that research, often funded out of the public purse, should be a public good. Given its visionary characteristics and its congruence with the aims of scholarship, the purpose of this paper is to examine why OA is not practiced by all researchers, all the time, or more encouraged by library managers. Design/methodology/approach: The findings reported in the paper are built upon analyses of the literature, the current discussion occurring in e-lists and other public forums, and upon qualitative research using observation, document analysis, interview techniques and thematic analysis conducted as part of a PhD study in two Australian universities. Findings: One of the universities had a long-standing institutional mandate to encourage OA and the other did not. In terms of findings, of the universities studied, the institution with the mandate not only had a far greater proportion of its research output in its OA institutional repository but also the researchers and authors interviewed there had a deep understanding of, and engagement with, issues surrounding not just scholarly publishing but also OA and other publishing options. Further, OA and the mandate policy were reported by university executives as providing benefits both to individual researchers and to the institution as a whole. Originality/value: In analyzing the relationships and entanglements that exist between authors, universities, publishers and other actors we see how these reinforce the current publishing paradigm. While proposals for mandates are not new, this paper illustrates how one is acting in practice. It proposes that despite reservations among academic library managers a mandate can work in practice. Sometimes, a new actor, such as a mandate or deposit policy is required, to assist library and repository managers, to encourage authors to look beyond their existing frames and embrace OA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",a=openacces,m=interview; m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=unisupportstaff,geo=AUS,,,Kennan M.A.,,,,,,Library Management,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,13,0,1435124,0,2011,32,4,302,318,10.1108/01435121111132301,,,WOS:000486490600004,,2021-01-27

Change has been instigated and produced by the Internet and open access systems - such as disciplinary and institutional repositories and open access journals. However traditional scholarly publishing is strengthening its hold over prestigious journals thus resisting change. How then does the change come about? An attempt at answering this question led us to examine an institutional repository initiative in a University. As we identified and followed the actors (researchers, research papers, reward systems, institutional repository technology, library staff, RQF, etc.) we saw the emergence of new publishing practices and the forces preserving the old ones. By adopting Actor Network Theory (ANT) we came to understand the materiality, relationality and ambiguity of processes of reassembling scholarly publishing.

Recent announcements indicate that funding and evaluation bodies are becoming increasingly concerned that publicly funded research be made publicly available. The paper then reports a survey of all levels of academic staff plus research students at one Australian university, conducted in May 2006, prior to the introduction of an institutional repository. The survey, in line with previously reported surveys, found that while there was a high level of engagement with scholarly publishing, there was a low level of awareness of, or concern with, either open access (green' or 'gold') or the roles repositories can play in increasing accessibility of research. Practically, this indicates that much work needs to be done within this university to increase knowledge of, and change behaviours with regard to, open access and repositories if the university and its academics are to make the most of new funding requirements and research evaluation processes.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=AUS,,,"Kennan, Mary Anne",,,,J,,LEARNED PUBLISHING,English,Article,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Sch Informat Syst Technol & Management, Fac Business, AGSM, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,18,12,WILEY,0953-1513,,2007,20,2,138,146,10.1087/174148507X185117,,,WOS:000486982300007,,2021-01-27

A significant challenge for businesses and governments is the collaboration among actors who provide data, actors who consume data and actors who create new services and applications around the data. These actors synthesize a collaborative environment-called ecosystem. Open data ecosystems face many obstacles and researchers have focused their interest in establishing and validating them. The existing knowledge about the open data ecosystem from the business perspective is limited. The purpose of this study is to examine the actors of open data ecosystem and their relationships, their motivations in order to increase entrepreneurial activities as well as the business model elements which are required in open data based business. 6 interviews were carried out with actors from open data ecosystem so as to receive up-to-date information directly from actors and estimated how the current ecosystem enables new business opportunities for actors providing data and for actors utilizing data. The analysis of findings is based on the Business Model Canvas and results are presented according to the perspective of each actor of the ecosystem. Findings show that although actors are highly interested in using open data, there is a need for a new kind of business ecosystem that makes a win-win condition possible for all the actors in the open data ecosystem.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine factors that lead to the effective implementation and success of open data hackathons and innovation contests. Six case studies of open data hackathons and innovation contests held between 2014 and 2018 in Thessaloniki were studied in order to identify the factors leading to the success of hackathon contests using criteria from the existing literature. The results show that the most significant factors were clear problem definition, mentors' participation to the contest, level of support to participants by mentors in order to launch their applications to the market, jury members' knowledge and experience, the entry requirements of the competition, and the participation of companies, data providers, and academics. Furthermore, organizers should take team members' competences and skills, as well as the support of post-launch activities for applications, into consideration. This paper can be of interest to organizers of hackathon events because they could be knowledgeable about the factors that should take into consideration for the successful implementation of these events.",a=opendata,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=GRC,,,"Kitsios, Fotis; Kamariotou, Maria",,,,J,,INFORMATION,English,Article,,,,,"[Kitsios, Fotis; Kamariotou, Maria] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece",,42,1,MDPI,2078-2489,,2019,10,7,,,10.3390/info10070235,,,WOS:000495805100057,,2021-01-27

In particular, data is an important element for occupant-centric design and operation as occupants' presence and actions are affected by a high degree of uncertainty and, hence, are hard to model in general. For such research, data handling is an important challenge, and following an open science paradigm based on open data can increase efficiency and transparency of scientific work. This article reviews current practices and infrastructure for open data-driven research on occupant-centric design and operation of buildings. In particular, it covers related work on open data in general and for the built environment in particular, presents survey results for existing scientific practices, reviews technical solutions for handling data and metadata, discusses ethics and privacy protection and analyses principles for the sharing of open data.

University libraries are struggling to deal with these new realities at the same time as they provide a level of service with acceptable access to publications. The work of librarians is being heavily affected by the influence of copyright and licensing which together are creating barriers to open access.

Analysing the relevance and acceptance of the eResearch-infrastructure MO vertical bar RE data for motor research data,Open access; Data pooling; Motor competence; Survey; Repository,"Open access policy means free and unrestricted access to scientific knowledge. It facilitates efficient, transparent and sustainable scientific work. Research data as the basis of this knowledge is becoming more and more significant in this policy. The enormous amount of data being generated requires professional research data management. Data-sharing makes data reusable and reproducible, collaborated work between scientists increases across disciplinary boundaries. The eResearch infrastructure MO vertical bar RE data aims to provide free access to citable motor performance research data for a limited application area with high standardization possibilities. It enables an innovative use of digital object identifiers (DOI) as well as the data-pooling procedures. The present survey aims to examine the needs and relevance of MO vertical bar RE data. First this will be assessed by systematic investigation in repository databases, second by asking members of scientific institutions and members of practical fields (schools, preschools, sport clubs) who collect motor performance data using an online survey. The online survey participants were asked about their interest in using MO vertical bar RE data by themselves as well as their own disposition to access data in a free and open way in MO vertical bar RE data. Currently there is no database like MO vertical bar RE data providing access to motor research data. A total of 143 participants took part in the online survey and both groups, members of scientific institutions and members of practical fields, stated a high interest in using MO vertical bar RE data. Owners of data showed a higher interest than those participants who do not have their own data. The willingness to provide access to their own data in MO vertical bar RE data is very high (more than 70%).

To ascertain the level of usage of the paid open access option in hybrid open access journals in agriculture, we studied the agriculture-related journals published by six commercial publishers. These publishers offer authors the option of paying a fee, often close to $3,000 per article, to make their article immediately freely available, usually with a Creative Commons license. We defined agriculture broadly but also assigned each journal to a subspecialty (e.g., animal science) in order to see if there were differences based on these subdivisions. For each journal we gathered data for 2014-2015 and noted the total number of research articles and the number of those that were made freely available by authors paying the open access fee. To give context to our results we also surveyed local faculty in agricultural sciences, asking their reasons for considering the paid open access options and the sources of the funds to pay for it. Survey respondents were asked about their academic position and rank to see if there were differences to be noted. We also investigated the findability of the open access articles, noting if each individual publisher offered a way to easily locate all the freely available articles in a particular journal and if there are other avenues to easily locate these articles. © 2016, Association of College and Research Libraries.

Design/methodology/approach Pragmatism paradigm, mixed methods research approach and convergent parallel mixed method design was adopted. Simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, purposive sampling techniques and the sample size converter were the sampling procedures and methods employed. The questionnaire and interview guide were used as research instruments to gather relevant data for the study. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used as statistical tools to analyze quantitative and thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Findings Factors such as software, staffing, advocacy, marketing and policies are crucial in the development of OAIR strategy at the University of Ghana. Research limitations/implications Information from the National Accreditations Board (NAB) of Ghana (2018) indicates that Ghana has 92 Higher Educational Institutions (HEI). These are categorized into nine national public universities, eight technical universities, ten professional institutions and 65 private universities and university colleges. This article focuses only on five university libraries with the understanding that they were the only universities on the Directory of Open Access Repositories, authoritative international registries of repositories that provide data on the number of registered Institutional Repositories throughout the world. Practical implications It is envisaged that the findings will benefit policymakers, academic staff, university library management and librarians. Academic staff will recognize the need to use OAIR. OAIR managers and administrators will be able to determine the factors affecting the usage of OAIR in university libraries and will be able to design strategies on how OAIR can be sustained and managed. Originality/value The article suggests strategies for the usage of OAIR that are instrumental for university libraries in Ghana. The strategies consist of an Institutional Guideline that requires adequate marketing, policies, software and staffing.

Scientific work is often evaluated through the number of scientific publications in international journals and their citations. This article discusses the impact of open access (OA) on the number of citations for an institution from the field of civil engineering. We analyzed articles, published in 2007 in 14 international journals with impact factor, which are included in the Journal Citation Reports subject category Civil Engineering. The influence of open access on the number of citations was analyzed. The aim of our research was to determine if open access articles from the field of civil engineering receive more citations than non-open access articles. Based on the value of impact factor and ranking in quartiles, we also looked at the influence of the rank of journals on the number of citations, separately for OA and Non OA articles, in databases Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar. For 2,026 studied articles we found out that 22 % of them were published as OA articles. They received 29 % of all citations in the observed period. We can conclude by the significance level 5 % or less that in the databases WOS and Scopus the articles from top ranked journals (first quartile) achieved more citations than Non OA articles. This argument can be confirmed for some other journals from second quartile as well, while for the journals ranked into the third quartile it can't be confirmed. This could be confirmed only partly for journals from the second quartile, and would not be confirmed for journals ranked into the third quartile. This shows that open access is not a sufficient condition for citation, but increases the number of citations for articles published in journals with high impact.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=engtech,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,Artikel gespeichert,"Koler-Povh, Teja; Juznic, Primoz; Turk, Goran",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Koler-Povh, Teja; Turk, Goran] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Juznic, Primoz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Arts, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",,39,33,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2014,98,2,1033,1045,10.1007/s11192-013-1101-x,,,WOS:000501596000006,,2021-01-27

Assessing the potential interest of key stakeholders in an Australasia PubMed Central was the objective of this research. The investigation is novel, assisting in the development of open science infrastructure through its systematic analysis of the potential interest in, and viability of a biomedical repository for managing openly accessible research outputs for the Australasia region. The research adopted a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews and a focus group. Forty-four stakeholders located throughout Australia and New Zealand participated in the research. Participants expanded upon their experience of PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC and their use of information resources for research and clinical practice. The Evidence Based Healthcare (EBHC) pyramid was the theoretical model adopted to explain open biomedical repository processes. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis identified support for exploring membership of an international PMC system, in particular Europe PMC. Lessons learnt from PMC US, Europe PMC and PMC Canada (collectively known as PubMed Central International) informed the investigation. A major strength identified was that PubMed Central International has been able to achieve high levels of compliance way beyond that of most institutional repositories. A great threat faced is overcoming the difficulties of working together with other major world bodies and financially sustaining an Australasia PMC. Improving Australasian biomedical knowledge management processes may be possible from adopting a PMC for retrieving and transferring research, linked to the data underlying the research. This in turn could help put regional research under a brighter spotlight, potentially leading to improvements in research quality. There is an opportunity for a potential Australasia PMC to harvest biomedical research from the National Library of Australia's aggregator database, Trove and work closely with Europe PMC to avoid duplication of effort.

It was reviewed whether journals offer an open access option with a subsequent check of conditions as for example the type of open access, the fees and the licensing. As a result all journals in the field of medical informatics that had an impact factor in 2014 offer an open access option. A predominantly consistent pricing range was determined with an average fee of 2.248(sic) and a median fee of 2.207(sic). The height of a journals' open access fee did not correlate with the height of its Impact Factor.

Methods: The study consists of a main survey and two supplementary surveys. In the main survey, a manual Google search was performed to investigate whether full-text versions of articles from PubMed were freely available. Target samples were articles published in 2005, 2007, and 2009;  the searches were performed a year after publication in 2006, 2008, and 2010, respectively. Using the search results, we classified the OA provision methods into seven categories. The supplementary surveys calculated the OA rate using two search functions on PubMed: LinkOut'' and Limits.'' Results: The main survey concluded that the OA rate increased significantly between 2006 and 2010: the OA rate in 2010 (50.2%) was twice that in 2006 (26.3%). Furthermore, majority of OA articles were available from OA journal (OAJ) websites, indicating that OAJs have consistently been a significant contributor to OA throughout the period.

There are many examples of using the term open access culture, but without giving an explicit description of it. The aim of this research is to offer conceptualization of the open access culture, identify its main components, and determine the impact of this variable on the intention to use and the actual use of Open Educational Resources by the members of public higher education institutions in Croatia. The sample consisted of 427 respondents. Keeping in mind that culture has a significant impact on the behaviour of an individual, but it also manifests itself through this behaviour, the research model will be proposed. The variable open access culture will be observed on a personal, professional and organizational level and it will include attitudes, perception, norms and politics towards open access to scientific and educational content and knowledge sharing. For the purpose of this study a questionnaire was prepared. Each part of the variable open access culture, as well as the intention to use and the actual use of OER, has been tested using a set of statements with answers on a 5-degree Likert type scale. The respondents have expressed a moderate open access culture. The actual use of OER, as well as the intention to use OER, is also in the middle of measurement scale. In order to achieve the aim of this research, three main hypotheses have been proposed. The results of multiple regression analysis show that the proposed model with predictor variable open access culture has a significant prognostic value on the intention to use and the actual use of OER, with a stronger influence on the intention to use OER. Considering the individual influence of the components of the predictor variable, the open access culture at professional level has the strongest influence on the intention to use and the actual use of OER.",a=openaccess; a=openeducation,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=HRV,,,"Kurelovic, Elena Krelja",,,,J,,ZBORNIK VELEUCILISTA U RIJECI-JOURNAL OF THE POLYTECHNICS OF RIJEKA,English,Article,,,,,"[Kurelovic, Elena Krelja] Polytech Rijeka, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",,16,1,POLYTECHNIC RIJEKA,1848-1299,,2018,6,1,39,50,,,,WOS:000509630200007,,2021-01-27

The paper specifically reports the initiatives at Zimbabwean universities regarding institutional repositories that promote OA and other digital OA collections. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research methodology was adopted. Questionnaires were used as the primary data collection method for this research. The research sought to address the following specific areas: the state of institutional repositories and open access in Zimbabwe, the discoverability of content, open access policies and mandates, the benefits of open access in Zimbabwe, and future plans for institutional OA. A total of eight out of 12 universities responded to the questionnaire. The data provided by the universities involved in the research were summarised to give a general picture of the open access landscape in Zimbabwe. Findings - The current initiatives in the universities involved in this survey indicate that most universities in Zimbabwe are going to have institutional repositories that promote open access to information. Most institutions in Zimbabwe are already working on putting open access policies in place in a bid to promote open access.

Although a substantial number of journals have practiced delayed OA since they started publishing e-versions, empirical studies concerning OA have often overlooked this body of literature. This study provides comprehensive quantitative measurements by identifying delayed OA journals and collecting data concerning their publication volumes, embargo lengths, and citation rates. Altogether, 492 journals were identified, publishing a combined total of 111,312 articles in 2011;  77.8% of these articles were made OA within 12 months from publication, with 85.4% becoming available within 24 months. A journal impact factor analysis revealed that delayed OA journals have citation rates on average twice as high as those of closed subscription journals and three times as high as immediate OA journals. Overall, the results demonstrate that delayed OA journals constitute an important segment of the openly available scholarly journal literature, both by their sheer article volume and by including a substantial proportion of highimpact journals.",a=openaccess,m=biblio; m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Laakso, Mikael;  Bjork, Bo-Christer",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Laakso, Mikael;  Bjork, Bo-Christer] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,18,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,1532-2882,,2013,64,7,1323,1329,10.1002/asi.22856,,,WOS:000511107200006,,2021-01-27

Included in the study are the five largest publishers of scholarly journals;  Elsevier, Springer, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor & Francis, and Sage. Since no central indexing or standardized metadata exists for identifying hybrid OA an explorative bottom-up methodological approach was developed. The individual search and filtering features of each publisher website and a-priori availability of data were leveraged to the extent possible. The results indicate a strong sustained growth in the volume of articles published as hybrid OA during 2007 (666 articles) to 2013 (13994 articles). The share of hybrid articles was at 3.8% of total published articles for the period of 2011-2013 for journals with at least one identified hybrid OA article. Journals within the Scopus discipline categorization of Health and Life Sciences, in particular the field of Medicine, were found to be among the most frequent publishers of hybrid OA content. The study surfaces the many methodological challenges involved in obtaining metrics regarding hybrid OA, a growing business for journal publishers as science policy pressures for reduced access barriers to research publications.

1467,WOS,isabel_steinhardt,Anatomy of open access publishing: a study of longitudinal development and internal structure,Open access;  scientific publishing,"Background: Open access (OA) is a revolutionary way of providing access to the scholarly journal literature made possible by the Internet. The primary aim of this study was to measure the volume of scientific articles published in full immediate OA journals from 2000 to 2011, while observing longitudinal internal shifts in the structure of OA publishing concerning revenue models, publisher types and relative distribution among scientific disciplines. The secondary aim was to measure the share of OA articles of all journal articles, including articles made OA by publishers with a delay and individual author-paid OA articles in subscription journals (hybrid OA), as these subsets of OA publishing have mostly been ignored in previous studies. Methods: Stratified random sampling of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (n = 787) was performed. The annual publication volumes spanning 2000 to 2011 were retrieved from major publication indexes and through manual data collection. Results: An estimated 340,000 articles were published by 6,713 full immediate OA journals during 2011. OA journals requiring article-processing charges have become increasingly common, publishing 166,700 articles in 2011 (49% of all OA articles). This growth is related to the growth of commercial publishers, who, despite only a marginal presence a decade ago, have grown to become key actors on the OA scene, responsible for 120,000 of the articles published in 2011. Publication volume has grown within all major scientific disciplines, however, biomedicine has seen a particularly rapid 16-fold growth between 2000 (7,400 articles) and 2011 (120,900 articles). Over the past decade, OA journal publishing has steadily increased its relative share of all scholarly journal articles by about 1% annually. Approximately 17% of the 1.66 million articles published during 2011 and indexed in the most comprehensive article-level index of scholarly articles (Scopus) are available OA through journal publishers, most articles immediately (12%) but some within 12 months of publication (5%).

Empirical research on the development of open access (OA) is still scarce and methodologically fragmented, and research on the relationship between journal copyright restrictions and actual free online availability is non-existent. In this study the free availability of articles published in eight top journals within the field of Information Systems (IS) is analyzed by observing the availability of all articles published in the journals during 2010-2014 (1515 articles in total) through the use of Google and Google Scholar. The web locations and document versions of retrieved articles for up to three OA copies per published article were categorized manually. The web findings were contrasted to journal copyright information and augmented with citation data for each article. Around 60 % of all published articles were found to have an OA copy available. The findings suggest that copyright restrictions weakly regulate actual author-side dissemination practice.

This study provides a detailed mapping of the bibliometric state of open access to journal publications among ethicists, taking into account not only open access publishing in journals directly, but also where and in what form ethicists make their journal articles available elsewhere on the web. As part of the study 297 ethicists affiliated with top-ranking philosophy departments were identified and their journal publication information for the years 2010-2015 were recorded (1682 unique articles). The journal articles were then queried for through Google Scholar in order to establish open access status (web locations, document versions) of each publication record. Publication records belonging to the 20 most frequently used journal outlets (subset of 597 unique articles) were put under closer inspection with regards to alignment with publisher copyright restrictions as well as measuring unused potential to share articles. The results show that slightly over half of recent journal publications are available to read for free. PhilPapers and academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate) were found to be key platforms for research dissemination in ethics research. The representation of institutional repositories as providers of access was found to be weak, receiving the second lowest frequency rating among the eight discrete web location categories.

The full text of OA journals and articles can be freely read, as the publishing is funded through means other than subscriptions. Empirical research concerning the quantitative development of OA publishing has so far consisted of scattered individual studies providing brief snapshots, using varying methods and data sources. This study adopts a systematic method for studying the development of OA journals from their beginnings in the early 1990s until 2009. Because no comprehensive index of OA articles exists, systematic manual data collection from journal web sites was conducted based on journal-level data extracted from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Due to the high number of journals registered in the DOAJ, almost 5000 at the time of the study, stratified random sampling was used. A separate sample of verified early pioneer OA journals was also studied. The results show a very rapid growth of OA publishing during the period 1993-2009. During the last year an estimated 191 000 articles were published in 4769 journals. Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18% for the number of journals and 30% for the number of articles. This can be contrasted to the reported 3,5% yearly volume increase in journal publishing in general. In 2009 the share of articles in OA journals, of all peer reviewed journal articles, reached 7,7%. Overall, the results document a rapid growth in OA journal publishing over the last fifteen years. Based on the sampling results and qualitative data a division into three distinct periods is suggested: The Pioneering years (1993-1999), the Innovation years (2000-2004), and the Consolidation years (2005-2009).",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,"n=Journals, also include n=articles",,"Laakso, Mikael;  Welling, Patrik;  Bukvova, Helena;  Nyman, Linus;  Bjork, Bo-Christer;  Hedlund, Turid",,,,J,,PLOS ONE,English,Article,,,,,"[Laakso, Mikael;  Welling, Patrik;  Nyman, Linus;  Bjork, Bo-Christer;  Hedlund, Turid] HANKEN Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland;  [Bukvova, Helena] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany",,26,264,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,2011,6,6,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0020961,,,WOS:000512885000006,21695139,2021-01-27

The results suggest that for this cultural transition to occur, the responsibility for strengthening transparency and openness must be undertaken not only by scientists and researchers, but also research funding and delivery agencies, and even those beyond the research and innovation sector.

In this case study I have examined openness strategies, practices and attitudes in two open collaboration research projects created by Finnish researchers, in order to understand what made them resistant to the fear of scooping. The radically open approach of the projects includes open by default funding proposals, co-authorship and community membership. Primary sources used are interviews of the projects’ founding members. The analysis indicates that openness requires trust in close peers, but not necessarily in research community or society at large. Based on the case study evidence, focusing on intrinsic goals, like new knowledge and bringing about ethical reform, instead of external goals such as publications, supports openness. Understanding fundaments of science, philosophy of science and research ethics, can also have a beneficial effect on willingness to share. Whether there are aspects in open sharing that makes it seem riskier from the point of view of certain demographical groups within research community, such as women, could be worth closer inspection. © 2017 The Author(s).",a=opendata,m=other; m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=FIN,m=case Study,,Laine H.,,,,,,Data Science Journal,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,6,Ubiquity Press Ltd,16831470,0,2017,16,0,0,0,10.5334/dsj-2017-029,,,WOS:000513801000010,,2021-01-27

This study assesses the quality of Open Access environmental data and barriers to its accessibility in the Thames Estuary. Data quality is assessed by its ability to track long-term trends in temperature, salinity, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen. The inconsistencies found in the data required analyses and careful interpretation beyond what would be expected of a citizen. The lack of clear documentation and centralized database acted as a major barrier to usability. A set of recommendations are produced for estuarine monitoring, including defining minimum standards for metadata, creating a centralized database for better quality control and accessibility, and developing flexible monitoring protocols that can incorporate new hypotheses and partnerships.

The responsibility for funding open access is more likely to fall on the author or a granting organization than the library or institution. 23% of libraries in this survey help finance open access, and one-third of these had established criteria for funding. While librarians disagreed on the appropriate level of their involvement in the publishing process and financing of article charges, the majority viewed the library as an important advocate for open access publishing in their institution.

A socio-technical lens, the social construction of technology, was used to analyse a qualitative cross-case study of two Swedish municipalities. Findings revealed two ways of interpreting open data initiatives: 1) as a platform for techno-economic growth and 2) as a platform for co-created societal growth. These two approaches addressed the municipalities respective contextual challenges and interests alongside national recommendations in their aims to realize the open data initiative. In doing so, they diverged into the evolvement toward two different ends: the realization of open data and the realization of open government. To excel the understanding of actions taken to meet these ends, an additional set of differences between these municipalities is provided within a sociotechnical framework that allows us to discuss diverging evolvements of open data initiatives based on agreed and non-agreed interpretations of what is believed to be constructed.",a=opendata,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=university,geo=SWE,m=case study,,"Lassinantti, Josefin; Bergvall-Kareborn, Birgitta; Stahlbrost, Anna",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH,English,Article,,,,,"[Lassinantti, Josefin; Bergvall-Kareborn, Birgitta; Stahlbrost, Anna] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Lulea, Sweden",,74,16,"UNIV TALCA, FAC INGENIERIA",0718-1876,,2014,9,2,17,33,10.4067/S0718-18762014000200003,,,WOS:000518027900002,,2021-01-27

It is an opportunity for librarians to engage with the research community and demonstrate the value that they bring to their organisations in the area of disseminating scholarly output. Although thousands of events have been held since the inception of OA Week, a minimal amount of research has been carried out regarding the impact of these events. This article presents a review of the literature on OA Week and evaluates the effectiveness of three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland through the use of statistics and a survey. The three events held during OA Week 2015 in Ireland that were evaluated include: a seminar run by Repository Network Ireland (RNI), a D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything And Read) campaign using OA materials organized by Dr. Steevens' Library, and a collaborative OA seminar between Dr. Steevens' Library and Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) libraries.

This study explores the extent to which an institutional repository makes papers available and accessible on the open Web by using 170 journal articles housed in DigiNole Commons, the institutional repository at Florida State University. Method. To analyse the repository’s impact on availability and accessibility, we conducted independent known-item title searches on both Google and Google Scholar (GS) to search for faculty publications housed in DigiNole Commons. Analysis. The extent to which the repository makes articles available and accessible was measured quantitatively and the findings that cannot be summarized with numbers were analysed qualitatively. Results. Google and Google Scholar searches provided links to DigiNole metadata for a total of 145 (85.3%) of 170 items, and to full texts for 96 (96%) of 100 items. With one exception, access to either metadata or full text required no more than three clicks. Conclusions. Overall, the results confirm the contribution of the institutional repository in making papers available and accessible. The results also reveal some impediments to the success of open access, including impediments linked to contractual arrangements between authors and publishers, impediments linked to policies, practices and technologies governing the repository itself, and the low level of faculty participation in the repository. © the author, 2015.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=USA,a=repository,,"Lee J., Burnett G., Vandegrift M., Baeg J.H., Morris R.",,,,,,Information Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,9,University of Sheffield,13681613,0,2015,20,1,0,0,,,,WOS:000522019000005,,2021-01-27

It also identifies the web performance of these repositories as reflected through global visibility. Data obtained from the Open Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR), Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) and the Ranking Web of World Repositories (RWWR) were used to analyse the availability and global visibility. Findings indicate that the total number of digital repositories in ASEAN is 51 with Indonesia as the biggest contributor (20, 39 percent), followed by Malaysia (17, 33 percent) and Thailand (7, 13 percent). Out of the 51 ASEAN digital repositories identified from OpenDOAR and ROAR, only 23 (45 percent) are listed in RWWR. RWWR's data indicates that only about 3 percent (33 out of 1,184 repositories worldwide) in ASEAN are visible. There are another 10 digital repositories identified in RWWR which are not listed under OpenDOAR or registered under ROAR. As such this study has identified a total of 61 ASEAN repositories participating in Open Access publishing through the Green Road. Findings suggest that ASEAN repositories which wish to be listed in RWWR need to have some degree of visibility and incorporate good practices in their web publication to fulfill the requirement of RWWR quantitative webometrics indicators, namely visibility, size, rich files and `scholar'.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=AS,a=repository,,"Lee-Hwa, Tan; Abrizah, A.; Noorhidawati, A.",,,,J,,INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT,English,Article,,,,,"[Lee-Hwa, Tan] KBU Int Coll, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Abrizah, A.; Noorhidawati, A.] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",,15,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,0266-6669,,2013,29,3,274,285,10.1177/0266666912466754,,,WOS:000522449700060,,2021-01-27
1523,WOS,isabel_steinhardt,How Does One Open Science? Questions of Value in Biological Research,academic disciplines and traditions; archiving and collecting practices; politics; power; governance; methodologies; methods,"Open Science policies encourage researchers to disclose a wide range of outputs from their work, thus codifying openness as a specific set of research practices and guidelines that can be interpreted and applied consistently across disciplines and geographical settings. In this paper, we argue that this one-size-fits-all view of openness sidesteps key questions about the forms, implications, and goals of openness for research practice. We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences. To illustrate these claims, we use three case studies that highlight the challenges surrounding decisions about how-and how best-to make things open. These cases, drawn from ethnographic engagement with Open Science debates and semistructured interviews carried out with UK-based biologists and bioinformaticians between 2013 and 2014, show how the enactment of openness reveals judgments about what constitutes a legitimate intellectual contribution, for whom, and with what implications.",a=openpolicies,m=other; m=interview,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=GBR,m=case studies (3 institutions) with 22 Interviews,Artikel gespeichert,"Levin, Nadine; Leonelli, Sabina",,,,J,,SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES,English,Article,,,,,"[Levin, Nadine] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Soc & Genet, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Leonelli, Sabina] Univ Exeter, Exeter Ctr Study Life Sci Egenis, Byrne House,St Germans Rd, Exeter EX4 4PJ, Devon, England; [Leonelli, Sabina] Univ Exeter, Dept Sociol Philosophy & Anthropol, Byrne House,St Germans Rd, Exeter EX4 4PJ, Devon, England",,83,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,0162-2439,,2017,42,2,280,305,10.1177/0162243916672071,,,WOS:000524746000015,28232768,2021-01-27

High-quality observatory data is freely available and accessible to all members of the global oceanographic community-a democratization of data that is particularly useful for early career scientists (ECS), enabling ECS to conduct research independent of traditional funding models or access to laboratory and field equipment. The concurrent collection of distinct data types with relevance for oceanographic disciplines including physics, chemistry, biology, and geology yields a unique incubator for cutting-edge, timely, interdisciplinary research. These data are both an opportunity and an incentive for ECS to develop the computational skills and collaborative relationships necessary to interpret large data sets. Here, we use observatory data to demonstrate the potential for these interdisciplinary approaches by presenting a case study on the water-column response to anomalous atmospheric events (i.e., major storms) on the shelf of the Mid-Atlantic Bight southwest of Cape Cod, United States. Using data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array, we applied a simple data mining method to identify anomalous atmospheric events over a four-year period. Two closely occurring storm events in late 2018 were then selected to explore the dynamics of water-column response using mooring data from across the array. The comprehensive ECS knowledge base and computational skill sets allowed identification of data issues in the OOI data streams and technologically sound characterization of data from multiple sensor packages to broadly characterize ocean-atmosphere interactions. An ECS-driven approach that emphasizes collaborative and interdisciplinary working practices adds significant value to existing datasets and programs such as OOI and has the potential to produce meaningful scientific advances. Future success in utilizing ocean observatory data requires continued investment in ECS education, collaboration, and research; in turn, the ECS community provides feedback, develops knowledge, and builds new tools to enhance the value of ocean observing systems. These findings present an argument for building a community of practice to augment ECS ocean scientist skills and foster collaborations to extend the context, reach, and societal utility of ocean science.",a=opendata,m=other,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=USA,m=case study,,"Levine, Robert M.; Fogaren, Kristen E.; Rudzin, Johna E.; Russoniello, Christopher J.; Soule, Dax C.; Whitaker, Justine M.",,,,J,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Levine, Robert M.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fogaren, Kristen E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Rudzin, Johna E.] US Naval Res Lab, Natl Res Council, Monterey, CA USA; [Russoniello, Christopher J.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Soule, Dax C.] CUNY Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Whitaker, Justine M.] Nicholls State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USA; [Fogaren, Kristen E.] Boston Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",,60,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,2020,7,,,,10.3389/fmars.2020.593512,,,WOS:000524972200009,,2021-01-27

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether, compared to reviews for a journal with single-blind peer review, reviews for a journal with open peer review included (1) fewer self-citations;  (2) a lower proportion of self-citations without a rationale;  and (3) a lower ratio of proportions of citations without a rationale in self-citations versus citations to others' work. Methods: Peer reviews for published manuscripts submitted in 2012 to a single-blind peer review journal, the Journal of Psychosomatic Research, were previously evaluated (Thombs et al., 2015). These were compared to publically available peer reviews of manuscripts published in 2012 in an open review journal, BMC Psychiatry. Two investigators independently extracted data for both journals. Results: There were no significant differences between journals in the proportion of all reviewer citations that were self-citations (journal of Psychosomatic Research: 71/225, 32%;  BMC Psychiatry: 90/315,29%;  p = .50), or in the proportion of self-citations without a rationale (journal of Psychosomatic Research: 15/71, 21%;  BMC Psychiatry: 12/90, 13%;  p = .21). There was no significant difference between journals in the proportion of self-citations versus citations to others' work without a rationale (p = 31). Conclusion: Blind and open peer review methodologies have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The present study found that, in reasonably similar journals that use single-blind and open review, there were no substantive differences in the pattern of peer reviewer self-citations.

Design/methodology/approach - Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings - The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications - The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field. Practical implications - This survey has practical implications for computational linguists and for every application requiring new developments in natural language processing. In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved.

Open access (OA) journals allows access to research papers free of charge to the reader. Traditionally, biomedical researchers use databases like MEDLINE and EMBASE to discover new advances. However, biomedical OA journals might not fulfill such databases' criteria, hindering dissemination. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is a database exclusively listing OA journals. The aim of this study was to investigate DOAJ's coverage of biomedical OA journals compared with the conventional biomedical databases. Methods. Information on all journals listed in four conventional biomedical databases (MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE and SCOPUS) and DOAJ were gathered. Journals were included if they were (1) actively publishing, (2) full OA, (3) prospectively indexed in one or more database, and (4) of biomedical subject. Impact factor and journal language were also collected. DOAJ was compared with conventional databases regarding the proportion of journals covered, along with their impact factor and publishing language. The proportion of journals with articles indexed by DOAJ was determined. Results. In total, 3,236 biomedical OA journals were included in the study. Of the included journals, 86.7% were listed in DOAJ. Combined, the conventional biomedical databases listed 75.0% of the journals;  18.7% in MEDLINE;  36.5% in PubMed Central;  51.5% in SCOPUS and 50.6% in EMBASE. Of the journals in DOAJ, 88.7% published in English and 20.6% had received impact factor for 2012 compared with 93.5% and 26.0%, respectively, for journals in the conventional biomedical databases. A subset of 51.1% and 48.5% of the journals in DOAJ had articles indexed from 2012 and 2013, respectively. Of journals exclusively listed in DOAJ, one journal had received an impact factor for 2012, and 59.6% of the journals had no content from 2013 indexed in DOAJ. Conclusions.

1548,WOS,isabel_steinhardt,An Exploratory Survey of the Suspicious Open Access Journals,Open Access Journals; Predatory Publishing; Scholarly Communication,"This paper describes the results of a survey of possibly predatory open access journals. Based on Jeffrey Beall's compilations of predatory publishers and standalone journals, the study identified 891 publishers and 7,726 journals with content at the end of January 2015, of which 1,989 journals were published by twelve mega publishers that had published over one hundred journal titles. The distributions of all journals versus journals from the mega publishers by paper quantity, journal debut year/journal age, and subject were systematically examined and compared. It was found that, at the time of this study, nearly half of the publishers had only one non-empty journal. Nearly 2/3 of the 7,726 non-empty journals had published only 50 or less papers, and half of them were debuted within two years. As high as 90% of the journals targeted science, technology, and medicine (STM), and the three domains had roughly equal shares of the journals. A sample of 11,419 articles was further drawn from the journals with more than 100 papers and those with 10 or less papers. The analysis of the first authors showed that India, United States and Nigeria were the top three contributors to suspicious journals; they together constituted approximately 50% of the sample.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=nonspecific,a/t=predadory journals,,"Lin, Chi-Shiou",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,English,Article,,,,,"[Lin, Chi-Shiou] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",,26,0,"NATL TAIWAN UNIV, DEPT LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE",1606-7509,,2017,15,2,45,66,10.6182/jlis.2017.15(2).045,,,WOS:000534851200005,,2021-01-27

1559,WOS,isabel_steinhardt,How open access policies affect access to grey literature in university digital repositories: A case study of iSchools,Best practice; Grey literature; Information access; Information policy; Information science; Library science; Open access; Scholarly communication; University repository,"An issue of interest to library and information science (LIS) scholars and practitioners is how open-access policies can affect the access and use of grey literature in university repositories. Open access (OA) refers to research placed online free from all price barriers and from most permission barriers (Suber, 2015), allowing unfettered access to scholarship and promoting open scholarly communication (Banach, 2011; Eysenbach, 2006). OA may apply research published traditionally, such as books (Schwartz, 2012) and academic articles (Suber, 2015), and non-traditionally published grey literature, such as electronic theses and dissertations (Schöpfel & Prost, 2013; Schöpfel & Lipinski, 2012). The treatment of grey literature in university repositories is of particular import due to “the ephemeral and changing nature of grey publication types, editions, and formats” (Rucinski, 2015, p. 548; see Farace & Schöpfel, 2010). The access and use of grey literature in these repositories is often executed through an OA policy. There is a gap in the literature, however, regarding best practices for drafting and implementing OA policies that promote unfettered access to grey literature. This paper analyzes OA policies from a sample of U.S. iSchools, created by cross-referencing the Directory of North American iSchools (iSchools, 2017) with the top twenty-five best LIS programs as ranked by U.S. News and World Reports (U.S. News, 2017). Initial analysis shows that of the twenty-two iSchools in the sample, all schools have repositories, ten have OA policies in place, and three have proposed OA policies. This project maps five OA policies against variables drawn from the benchmark of open scholarly communication, the Harvard Open Access Project’s “Good Practices for University Open-Access Policies” (Shieber & Suber, 2017). The goal of this paper is to understand how OA policies at university repositories affect access to grey literature in an ever-changing information landscape. Based on the analysis of the sampled iSchool OA policies and the Harvard variables, it recommends best practices for drafting and implementing OA policies that provide unfettered access to grey literature in repositories. © 2018 TextRelease.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=natscie,t=other,geo=USA,t=repositories,,"Lipinski T.A., Kritikos K.C.",,,,,,Grey Journal,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,2,GreyNet,15741796,0,2018,14,1,6,20,,,,WOS:000539134600001,,2021-01-27

Such data is referred to as open scientifi c data. Four key drivers are identifi ed: (i) Changing societal approaches and increasing expectations that the outcomes of publicly-funded research be freely available, (ii) the emergence of data journals; (iii) changing policies of research funders and publishers; and (iv) the requirements for research organisations and individual researchers to comply with these policies and introduce research data management plans. In this chapter, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is used as a case study to show how open scientifi c data can be successfully managed and used, in innovative ways, to deliver open education in particle physics. Finally, this chapter identifi es three challenges that require attention of research funders and scientifi c organisations. First, the challenge to devise a minimum standard for open scientifi c data. Second, the challenge to develop incentives for researchers and librarians, and third, the challenge to reconceptualise the ownership of open scientifi c data. This chapter argues that addressing these challenges can advance the preservation and sharing of open scientifi c data for the global public good. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

It provides a searchable index to peer-reviewed e-books published under an open access business model, with links to the full text of the publications at the Open Access Publishing in European Networks (OAPEN) Library, publisher's website or repositories. The present study aims to assess the current trends of the open access e-books in the field of science and technology available through DOAB. The data was collected online regarding the science and technology e-books in March 2014 for analysis. The results reveal that 307 e-books are available on science and technology through DOAB falling in three categories-monographs (209, 68.08 %), book series (93, 30.29 %) and conference proceedings (5,1.63 %). These e-books deal with eight major subject areas of Science and Technology having 36 sub-fields. The maximum number of e-books is available on General Science (95), Technology & Engineering (54), Earth & Environmental Sciences (50) & Health & Medical Sciences (47). In sub-fields most of the e-books cover Computer Sciences (24), Information Theory (24), General Medicine (20), Mathematics (17), Biology (13) & Geography (11). The authorship trends show that the maximum contribution is by single author (51.14 %) followed by two authors (74, 24.10 %) and three authors (36, 11.73 %). The linguistic assessment shows that 57.98 % (178) of these e-books have been published in English followed in German (88, 28.66%) and Italian (18, 5.86 %) respectively. The publishing trends reveal that 59.93 % (184) e-books have contributed by university presses whereas 40.07 % (123) by other publishing houses around the world.

Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the objectives of the study, the OpenDOAR was selected as a source for identifying the H&M repositories. The required data were manually collected from 1 to 30 April 2014 and analysed using various quantitative techniques to reveal the findings. Findings -The results reveal that the OpenDOAR lists 254 repositories in the field of the H&M contributed by the 62 countries of the world, topped by the USA (15.4 per cent), followed by Japan (7.9 per cent) and the UK (7.5 per cent). The majority of the repositories are institutional (187, 73.6 per cent) in nature, having less than 5,000 items (161, 63.4 per cent) in the collection and mostly consisting of articles (76.0 per cent), theses (49.6 per cent), unpublished documents (33.1 per cent) and books (31.9 per cent). The linguistic assessment shows that the majority of the H&M repositories accept content written in English language (71.3 per cent), followed by Spanish (16.1 per cent) and Japanese (7.5 per cent). The updating policy of these repositories is not up to the mark, as only 67.0 per cent of the H&M repositories have been updated from 2008-2012, but the majority are still operational (91.7 per cent) and are compatible (67.3 per cent) with the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). About 30 software brands, both commercial and open source, have been used by administrators for creating these repositories and managing their content. DSpace is the most popular software used by 88 (34.7 per cent) repositories, followed by EPrints (43, 16.9 per cent) and Digital Commons (18, 7.1 per cent). Research limitations/implications - The scope of this study is limited to the health and medical repositories listed in OpenDOAR, and hence the generalisation is to be cautioned. Practical implications - This study is useful for library and information professionals and health and medical professionals across the globe.

This research presents the case of communication academic journals in Mexico. It briefly presents some of its background, current state, challenges and difficulties. It also provides the number of undergraduate and graduate communication programs in the country in order to reflect on their current state. Methodology: The work is descriptive and it is based on the review of open access academic publications that treat communication topics and sub-topics. It identifies the characteristics that give them the description of academic, examines their visibility through database indexing, access formats, use of Open Journal Systems (OJS), inclusion of the digital object identifier (DOI), use of anti-plagiarism programs, adhesion to the Committee on Publication Ethics (Cope), use of Creative Commons licenses and registration of quotes in Google Scholar, diversity in access formats, among others. Results and discussion: The current state of open access communication publications in Mexico is specified. The fact that the number of existing publications is insufficient and that they coexist with their print versions but electronic versions are lagging behind technological advancement and international standardization processes is what leaves them outside of the interest of national authors for publication. It also recognizes the existence of journals endorsed by educational institutions that are not precisely interested in being indexed to national and international databases, since its endogamous/institutional role allows them to be a learning platform for the training of academics who experiment the art of publishing for the first time.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=socscie,t=other,geo=MEX,t=journals,,"Lopez-Ornelas, Maricela; Osuna Lever, Cecilia; Diaz Lopez, Karla Maria",,,,J,,REVISTA LATINA DE COMUNICACION SOCIAL,Spanish,Article,,,,,"[Lopez-Ornelas, Maricela] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico; [Osuna Lever, Cecilia; Diaz Lopez, Karla Maria] Sistema CETYS Univ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,32,5,LABORATORIO TECNOLOGIAS INFORMACION & NUEVOS ANALISIS COMUNICACION SOCIAL,1138-5820,,2017,72,5,475,499,10.4185/RLCS-2017-1175,,,WOS:000548294000001,,2021-01-27

Although Health Sciences have been one of the leading fields promoting Open Access, the perspectives of Health Science researchers on the benefits and possibilities of Open Access remain an open question. The present study sought to unveil the perspective of researchers on scientific publication decisions, in terms of the Subscription and Open Access publication model, Gold Road. With this aim, we surveyed Spanish researchers in Health Sciences. Our findings show that the value of publishing in Open Access journals increases as the experience of the researcher increases and the less she/he values the impact factor. Moreover, visibility and dissemination of the results are the main determinants of publication when choosing an Open Access journal as the first option. According to the response of the researchers, the reduction of fees and the increase in financing are important economic incentive measures to promote the Open Access publication model.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a cross-sectional questionnaire survey, 415 faculty members were selected through a stratified random sampling from a population of 679 in all eight health sciences universities in Tanzania. The response rate was 71.1 per cent. Findings: Based on the social exchange theory (SET), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the study developed a model suitable for assessing open access adoption and usage in academic institutions. The study found that facilitating conditions, extrinsic benefits (professional recognition), behavioural intention and individual characteristics (professional rank, technical skills and number of publications) predicted actual usage of open access. Other factors related to contextual factors (attitude, and open access culture), and extrinsic benefits (academic reward, accessibility and preservation) determined behavioural intention to use open access. Fear to violate publisher's copyright policies and effort expectancy however de-motivated faculty to adopt open access, while copyright concerns inhibited faculty's actual usage of open access.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 librarians, while questionnaires were physically distributed to 415 faculty members in all eight Tanzanian health sciences universities, with a response rate of 71.1%. ResultsThe study found that most faculty members were aware about OA issues. However, the high level of OA awareness among faculty members did not translate into actual dissemination of faculty's research outputs through OA web avenues. A small proportion of faculty's research materials was made available as OA. Faculty were more engaged with OA journal publishing than with self-archiving practices. Senior faculty with proficient technical skills were more likely to use open access than junior faculty. Major barriers to OA usage were related to ICT infrastructure, awareness, skills, author-pay model, and copyright and plagiarism concerns. Interviews with librarians revealed that there was a strong support for promoting OA issues on campus; however, this positive support with various open access-related tasks did not translate into actual action. It is thus important for librarians and OA administrators to consider all these factors for effective implementation of OA projects in research and academic institutions.

The initial findings of faculty researchers' behaviors and practices toward research transparency, using the research data lifecycle as a grounding framework are reported. Four focus group sessions were conducted with faculty researchers in different disciplines, including natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, and different transparency practices were captured using the researchers' own language. Four generic transparency components were identified: action verb, object, task, and stage in the research lifecycle. The inter-relationships between specific transparency components were visualized using network visualizations. The network visualizations suggest that the lifecycle stages of Process/Visualize/Analyze and Publish/Preserve/Archive are key points for transparency, where 'data' play a critical role demonstrated by the multiple node-edge relationships. Based on the findings, a conceptual model, termed the Tasks-Toward-Transparency (T3) Model, was developed. This model may inform researcher practices and support research stakeholders whose role is to articulate and deliver transparency advocacy, policy, training programs, and services.",a=opendata; a=openaccess,m=interviews,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=USA; geo=GBR,,Artikel gespeichert,"Lyon, Liz; Jeng, Wei; Mattern, Eleanor",,,,J,,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,English,Article,,,,,"[Lyon, Liz; Mattern, Eleanor] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, 135 N Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Jeng, Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Res Econometr Theory & Applicat, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, 1 Sect,4 Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",,27,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,0740-8188,,2020,42,1,,,10.1016/j.lisr.2019.100999,,,WOS:000553913700001,,2021-01-27

To explore how this gap could be addressed and elicit requirements, we conducted a survey with 40 researchers in the field of technology-enhanced learning, examining their experience and needs handling research data. Drawing on the results of our survey, we devised a set of features that educational platforms should provide to address the identified requirements, enabling researchers in education to run studies within typical learning environments, adhere to legal and ethical frameworks concerning privacy, and share their data confidently with a wider audience. We then categorized these features into five stages that represent the user flow, namely (1) Bootstrapping Research Studies, (2) Ensuring Consent, (3) Gathering Data, (4) Managing Data Sets, and (5) Supporting Open Research and Collaboration. Our aim is to guide forthcoming research and developments to relieve researchers of the burdens of conducting data-sensitive experiments, support the adoption of best practices, and pave the way for open data policies in digital education. © 2019 IEEE.",a=opendata,m=survey,d=socscie,t=researcher,geo=EU,,,"MacHado J.S., Farah J.C., Gillet D., Rodriguez-Triana M.J.",,,,,,"Proceedings - IEEE 19th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2019",English,Conference Paper,"19th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2019",15 July 2019 through 18 July 2019,0,,,,,0,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,0,9781728134857,2019,0,0,209,211,10.1109/ICALT.2019.00048,,,WOS:000558316400001,,2021-01-27

1627,WOS,jana_lasser,The Dawn of Open Access to Phylogenetic Data,,"The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation - extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for similar to 60% of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Importantly, our survey spans recent policy initiatives and infrastructural changes; our analyses indicate that the positive impact of these community initiatives has been both dramatic and immediate. Although the results of our study indicate that the situation is dire, our findings also reveal tremendous recent progress in the sharing and preservation of phylogenetic data.",a=opendata,m=interview,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,Efforts to acquire data from 217 studies via repositories or direct requests from the authors,,"Magee, Andrew F.; May, Michael R.; Moore, Brian R.",,,,J,,PLOS ONE,English,Article,,,,,"[Magee, Andrew F.; May, Michael R.; Moore, Brian R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,52,25,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,2014,9,10,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0110268,,,WOS:000565063600001,25343725,2021-01-27

Therefore, this paper investigates the case of WoS publications of Iran (2001-2012) for impact of mentioned publication availability models on citation, Mendeley readership, and tweet counts across four broader disciplines. Findings on 98,453 articles show that gold OA papers (5%) do not benefit significantly more metric counts, except in tweets linking to OA medical publications. Articles in PubMed Central (3%) significantly advantage the three investigated metrics, whereas arXiv preprints (2%) had higher readership advantage only. Different from PubMed publications, tweets to OA medical research were not significantly correlated with citations, suggesting their social impact rather than scientific. Additionally, OA publications are not significantly read by Mendeley users in developing countries, but developed ones, only in life science and biomedicine.

The impact of open access (OA) journals is still understudied in the field of radiology. In this study, we compared the measures of impact (e.g., CiteScore, citation count, SCImago Journal Rank) between OA and subscription radiology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We collected data on journals included in the Scopus Source List on November 1, 2018. We filtered the list for radiology journals for the years from 2011 to 2017. OA journals covered by Scopus (Elsevier) are indicated as OA if the journal is listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals, the Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources, or both. We also compared citation metrics between OA and subscription radiology journals. RESULTS. The 2017 Scopus report included 265 radiology journals. The percentage of OA journals increased from 14.7% in 2011 to 21.9% in 2017 (49% increase). The median scholarly output and the citation count were both significantly lower in OA radiology journals compared with subscription journals (p < 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). The proportion of documents that received at least one citation was higher in OA (50.2%) compared with subscription journals (44.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION. This study found that the trend toward OA publishing in the fields of radiology and nuclear medicine has slowed in recent years, although the percent cited (i.e., the proportion of documents that receive at least one citation) is higher for OA journals.

On the whole, they have a perceived positive attitude towards open access journals and would like to use them in the future. Moreover, they have been using open access journals as an alternative access model to the conventional journals subscription model; and yet to optimize the benefits of open access among academics, they expect university librarians to promote and enhance the accessibility of open access journals in their respective university libraries and in Ethiopia in general.

It highlights any common factors between the approaches taken by each institution, as well as any significant differences of note. The findings reveal that each of the three institutions is at a different stage of development with the University of Hong Kong repository ranked at the top within Asia.

The credibility of academic publishing is now seriously threatened by predatory journals, whose articles are accorded real citations and thus contaminate the genuine scientific records of legitimate journals. This is of particular concern for public health since clinical practice relies on the findings generated by scholarly articles. Aim of this study was to compile a list of predatory journals targeting the neurosciences and neurology disciplines and to analyze the magnitude and geographical distribution of the phenomenon in these fields. Eighty-seven predatory journals operate in neurosciences and 101 in neurology, for a total of 2404 and 3134 articles issued, respectively. Publication fees range 521-637 USD, much less than those charged by genuine open-access journals. The country of origin of 26.0-37.0% of the publishers was impossible to determine due to poor websites or provision of vague or non-credible locations. Of the rest 35.3-42.0% reported their headquarters in the USA, 19.0-39.2% in India, 3.0-9.8% in other countries. Although calling themselves open-access, none of the journals retrieved was listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals. However, 14.9-24.7% of them were found to be indexed in PubMed and PubMed Central, which raises concerns on the criteria for inclusion of journals and publishers imposed by these popular databases. Scholars in the neurosciences are advised to use all the available tools to recognize predatory practices and avoid the downsides of predatory journals. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such questionable editorial practices are threatening the reputation and credibility of scholarly publishing. To date, no investigation has been conducted on this phenomenon in the field of rehabilitation. This study attempts to identify specific predatory journals operating in this field to quantify the phenomenon and its geographic distribution. Beall's List has been used to this end which, although not perfect, is a comprehensive and up-to-date report of predatory publfshers. Of the 1113 publishers on the list, 59 journals were identified, for a total of 5610 published articles. The median number of articles published by each journal was 21, and the median amount of article processing charges was $499. Only 1 out of 59 journals was included in the Directory of Open Access Journals, whereas 7 (12%) were indexed by PubMed. Most of the publishers were based in India (36%) followed by the United States (25%) and Pakistan (5%), and 25% were without a verifiable address. The data indicate that the threat of predatory publishing in rehabilitation is real.

With more agreements including some form of OA, consortia and academic institutions need to monitor the number of OA publications, the costs and the value of these agreements. Publishers are therefore required to account for the articles published OA to consortia, academic institutions and research funders. One way publishers can do so is by providing regular reports with article-level metadata. This article uses the Knowledge Exchange (KE) and the Efficiency and Standards for Article Charges (ESAC) initiative recommendations as a check-list to assess what article-level metadata consortia request from publishers and what metadata publishers deliver to consortia. KE countries' agreements with major publishers were analysed to assess how far consortia and publishers are from requesting and providing article-level metadata. The results from this research can be used as a benchmark to determine how major publishers were performing until early 2019 and prior to Plan S coming into effect in 2021.

The impact of these new regulations with the specific situation of that open-access pioneering discipline which is astrophysics, has been considered. Under a strictly technical point of view, in the light of the new dispositions the open nature of a part of the astrophysical scholarly literature which has been made available online free to the reader during the last twenty years, might be questionable. In astrophysics, most of the journal articles are published by a very small number of scientific societies and organizations. The copyright policies of these major publishing bodies have been collected and analyzed, with regard to the main requirements of the Italian law about open access. Most of these policies are sufficiently liberal for an entirely compliant open access to be provided and scientists would benefit from knowing these details more extensively.

We assessed the completeness of results reporting in abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in these journals. Methods: We used the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Checklist for Abstracts (CONSORT-A) to assess the completeness of reporting in abstracts of parallel-design RCTs published in subscription journals (n = 149; New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Lancet) and OA journals (n = 119; BioMedCentral series, PLoS journals) in 2016 and 2017. Results: Abstracts in subscription journals completely reported 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77-81%) of 16 CONSORT-A items, compared with 65% (95% CI, 63-67%) of these items in abstracts from OA journals (P < 0.001, chi-square test). The median number of completely reported CONSORT-A items was 13 (95% CI, 12-13) in subscription journal articles and 11 (95% CI, 10-11) in OA journal articles. Subscription journal articles had significantly more complete reporting than OA journal articles for nine CONSORT-A items and did not differ in reporting for items trial design, outcome, randomization, blinding (masking), recruitment, and conclusions. OA journals were better than subscription journals in reporting randomized study design in the title. Conclusion: Abstracts of randomized controlled trials published in subscription medical journals have greater completeness of reporting than abstracts published in OA journals. OA journals should take appropriate measures to ensure that published articles contain adequate detail to facilitate understanding and quality appraisal of research reports about RCTs.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=med,t=other,geo=nonspecific,"Investigates the completeness of abstracts of registered reports, compares between OA and subscription journals; StS changed to a=openaccess and to m=other = biblio/quantitative analysis???",,"Martinic-Cezar, Iva Jercic; Marusic, Ana",,,,J,,TRIALS,English,Article,,,,,"[Martinic-Cezar, Iva Jercic] Univ Hosp Ctr Split, Ctr Transfus Med, Split, Croatia; [Marusic, Ana] Univ Split, Dept Res Biomed & Hlth, Sch Med, Soltanska 2, Split 21000, Croatia",,30,0,BMC,,,2019,20,1,,,10.1186/s13063-019-3781-x,,,WOS:000579442800004,31791393,2021-01-27

All articles and reviews with a DOI and published in 2009 or 2014 and covered by the three main citation indexes in the Web of Science (2,269,022 documents) were selected for study. The links to freely available versions of these documents displayed in GS were collected. To differentiate between more reliable ( sustainable and legal) forms of access and less reliable ones, the data extracted from GS was combined with information available in DOAJ, CrossRef, OpenDOAR, and ROAR. This allowed us to distinguish the percentage of documents in our sample that are made OA by the publisher (23.1%, including Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, and Bronze OA) from those available as Green OA (17.6%), and those available from other sources (40.6%, mainly due to Research Gate). The data shows an overall free availability of 54.6%, with important differences at the country and subject category levels. The data extracted from GS yielded very similar results to those found by other studies that analysed similar samples of documents, but employed different methods to find evidence of OA, thus suggesting a relative consistency among methods.

Relevant data from Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Open DOAR and Sri Lanka Journals Online (SLJOL) were analyzed to study the status of open access in Sri Lanka. Further, websites of all established institutional repositories (IR) of Sri Lanka were explored to gather the relevant data. Semi-structured interviews with Librarian of National Science Foundation and the staff involved in the development of many IRs and digitization projects were also carried out. Findings show that many libraries in Sri Lanka have established institutional repositories. The recently created national open access policy is under review. Different universities and special libraries such as science and technology libraries were granted financial and technical support by the NSF for digitizing their rare contents. However, all digitized contents have not been uploaded yet. There are 60 locally published journals available online through SLJOL, but only 10 journals have been listed in DOAJ.

Specifically, the study investigates major predictors of usage intentions of OAJs. Data were collected from pilot study. A total of 60 (85.71%) usable questionnaires out of 70 were returned. The study utilized the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). The results show that attitude, content respectability and predatory publishers have insignificant effect on usage intention, while subjective norms and intention shows statistically significant effect on OAJs usage behavior. The study findings are useful to OAJs publishers and ARIs management staff to identify important factors and safeguard policies on Open Access publishing and strategies to encourage long-term usage of OAJs for future studies and lifelong learning. By using TRA in the context of actual usage intentions and the integration of an additional construct ""content respectability and predatory publisher"", the extended TRA model fits very well in the OAJs in Tanzania, in particular where such studies are scant.

Focusing on what can happen after the presumed finish line, this study identifies journals that have converted from OA to a subscription model, and places these reverse flips within the greater context of scholarly publishing. In particular, we examine specific journal descriptors, such as access mode, publisher, subject area, society affiliation, article volume, and citation metrics, to deepen our understanding of reverse flips. Our results show that at least 152 actively publishing journals have reverse-flipped since 2005, suggesting that this phenomenon does not constitute merely a few marginal outliers, but instead a common pattern within scholarly publishing. Notably, we found that 62% of reverse flips (N = 95) had not been born-OA journals, but had been founded as subscription journals, and hence have experienced a three-stage transformation from closed to open to closed. We argue that reverse flips present a unique perspective on OA, and that further research would greatly benefit from enhanced data and tools for identifying such cases.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=nonspecific,,,"Matthias, Lisa; Jahn, Najko; Laakso, Mikael",,,,J,,PUBLICATIONS,English,Article,,,,,"[Matthias, Lisa] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jahn, Najko] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen State & Univ Lib, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Laakso, Mikael] Hanken Sch Econ, Informat Syst Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland",,78,7,MDPI,2304-6775,,2019,7,2,,,10.3390/publications7020023,,,WOS:000587727100001,,2021-01-27

This paper aims to answer this question through an observational study of usage and citation data collected about the multidisciplinary, open access mega-journal Scientific Reports. This observational study answers these questions using the following methods: an overlap analysis of most read and top-cited articles; Spearman correlation tests between total citation counts over two years and usage over various timeframes; a comparison of first months of citation for most read and all articles; a Wilcoxon test on the distribution of total citations of early cited articles and the distribution of total citations of all other articles. All analyses were performed in using the programming language R. As Scientific Reports is a multidisciplinary journal covering all natural and clinical sciences, we also looked at the differences across subjects. We found a moderate correlation between usage in the first year and citations in the first two years since publication (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.49, alpha = 0.05), and that articles with high usage in the first six months are more likely to have their first citation earlier (Wilcoxon = 1,811,500, p < 0.0001), which is also related to higher citations in the first two years (Wilcoxon = 8,071,200, p < 0.0001).

The DRIVER I project drew up a detailed report of European repositories based on data gathered in a survey in which Spain's participation was very low. This created a highly distorted image of the implementation of repositories in Spain. This study aims to analyse the current state of Spanish open-access institutional repositories and to describe their characteristics. Method. The data were gathered through a Web survey. The questionnaire was based on that used by DRIVER I: coverage; technical infrastructure and technical issues; institutional policies; services created; and stimulators and inhibitors for establishing, filling and maintaining their digital institutional repositories. Analysis. Data were tabulated and analysed systematically according responses obtained from the questionnaire and grouped by coverage. Results. Responses were obtained from 38 of the 104 institutions contacted, which had 29 institutional repositories. This represents 78.3% of the Spanish repositories according to the BuscaRepositorios directory. Spanish repositories contained mainly full-text materials (journal articles and doctoral theses) together with metadata. The software most used was DSpace, followed by EPrints. The metadata standard most used was Dublin Core. Spanish repositories offered more usage statistics and fewer author-oriented services than the European average. The priorities for the future development of the repositories are the need for clear policies on access to scientific production based on public funding and the need for quality control indicators. Conclusions.This is the first detailed study of Spanish institutional repositories. The key stimulants for establishing, filling and maintaining were, in order of importance, the increase of visibility and citation, the interest of decision-makers, simplicity of use and search services. On the other hand the main inhibitors identified were the absence of policies, the lack of integration with other national and international systems and the lack of awareness efforts among academia. © the authors, 2009.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=university,geo=ESP,,,"Melero R., Abadal E., Abad F., Rodríguez-Gairín J.M.",,,,,,Information Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,18,0,13681613,0,2009,14,4,0,0,,,,,,2021-01-27

In many disciplines open access (OA) research is more frequently cited, although this has never before been demonstrated amongst anatomy publications. The objective of this study was to assess a selection of published anatomy papers to determine the effect of gold and bronze OA availability on citation rates. Materials and Methods:Taken together, 625 peer-reviewed publications were identified from 2927 abstracts presented at meetings of AACA (2003-2010) and BACA (2000-2015). Results:In total 18.75% (69 of 368) of papers presented at BACA and 21.79% (56 of 257) of those presented at AACA reached OA publication. Citation rates are significantly higher amongst OA papers as compared to non-OA papers presented at these two anatomy conferences (OA 18.95, Non-OA 15.14 p = 0.047). OA papers were most commonly themed around education and pure anatomy.

Design - Longitudinal reference list analysis. Setting - Public university in the United States of America. Subjects - Reference lists collected from final literature review papers in a graduate-level education class (n = 382). Methods - The authors collected reference lists from final literature review papers in a graduate-level education class for a nine-year time frame from the 2005 to 2013 academic years. The authors analyzed 2,594 reference entries from the 382 reference lists in the sample. The authors organized reference entries into spreadsheets for analysis, creating one spreadsheet per class section and sorting references by type (e.g., book, journal article, website, etc.) and source. The authors also created a cumulative list of journal titles that they analyzed for open access status and how often the journals appeared in the sample. Other information collected about each journal included ISSNs, national origin, journal sponsorship, frequency and years of student usage, presence of empirical research, [and] peer review status (p. 249). Finally, the authors organized open access journals into the following four categories based on their access method:. Category A OA Platform and Publisher. Category B Publisher Only. Category C Delay or Hybrid from Host or Publisher. Category D Subscription Based, but Self Archived (p. 249) Main Results - A total of 594 unique journals appeared in reference lists over the study period, and 11.5% (n= 68) of the total were open access journals. Of the open access journals, 96% (n= 65) included original research articles, and the majority (n= 51) fell into Category A OA Platform and Publisher. Nine, six, and two journal titles fell into categories B, C, and D, respectively. The authors found no pattern or change in the use of open access titles during the nine-year study period. Open access journals appeared in reference lists an average of 14 times per year with the highest usage observed in 2009. Conclusion - The results show that graduate students in the sample used a range of open access journals. The presence of open access resources in reference lists signals that students may use both library subscription databases and open web search tools to complete their literature review assignments. The authors suggest potential reasons why open access use did not grow during the study period, including a possible mismatch between student research interests and the topics present in open access titles, the lack of discussion about open access publishing during library instruction, or student satisfaction with the resources provided through library-sponsored subscriptions. Librarians are encouraged to include high-quality open access resources within their catalogues or other electronic resources to increase open access discoverability and to include popular open web search tools as a means to retrieve open access materials during information literacy instruction.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=socscie,t=other,geo=USA,,,"Miller, Kimberly",,,,J,,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,English,Article,,,,,"[Miller, Kimberly] Towson Univ, Albert S Cook Lib, Towson, MD 21252 USA",,5,0,UNIV ALBERTA,1715-720X,,2015,10,3,102,104,10.18438/B87S4C,,,,,2021-01-27

An analysis of Web of Science Core Collection and SciELO Citation Index (2005-2017),Open Access;  LA&C countries;  Scientific publications;  Bibliometric analysis,"Open Access (OA) initiatives and knowledge infrastructure represent vital elements for both producing significant changes in scholarly communication and reducing limitations of access to the circulation of scientific knowledge in developing countries. The spreading of the OA movement in Latin America and Caribbean (LA&C) countries, exemplified by the growth of regional and national initiatives, such as the creation of OA digital journal libraries and the establishment of supportive governmental policies, provides evidence of the significant role OA is playing in improving the participation of LA&C countries in the so-called global knowledge commons. In this paper, we map OA publications in LA&C countries through a bibliometric analysis of OA publications indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection and SciELO Citation Index during the period 2005-2017. Searches were done in the fields Country, Publication Year, Language, and Research Area using WoS analytical tools, in order to map the evolution, distribution, and characteristics of OA publications in the LA&C region. The analysis is conducted on both the sub-regional and national levels. On the sub-regional level, trends in the four LA&C sub-regions (Southern Cone, Central America and Mexico, Andes, and the Caribbean) are identified and compared. On the national level, the analysis identifies as most representative and focuses on nine countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru.

BRICS nations are fast emerging economies and contribute significantly in research output. This study makes an effort to analyze and explore the role of BRICS nations towards open access research data repository registered with Registry of Research Data Repositories. Design/methodology/approach The data were gathered from re3data repository, and the search was limited to BRICS nations. The data were further analyzed and tabulated as per set parameters, namely, country-wise distribution, types of contents, subject coverage and language diversity. Findings The findings depict that in terms of strength, India has the highest number of data repositories, thereby achieved the first rank among BRICS nations, and South Africa has the least number of data repositories, whereas in terms of content type and subject coverage, India again is leading among BRICS nations. The English language is used by repositories as the main language of the interface. Practical implications The study helps to understand the development of research data repositories by BRICS nations. The study is further beneficial to researchers, as Registry of Research Data Repository provides a single platform to access repositories from various disciplines. Readily available data saves time, money and efforts of researchers and helps the researcher in completing their research activity in a very short span of time. Originality/value The paper has investigated open access data repositories of BRICS nation that has not been attempted earlier. This gives readers comprehensive overview of research data repositories developed in fast emerging economies of the global.

1799,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,Understanding researchers' intention to publish in open access journals,Theory of planned behaviour (TPB); Open access; Intention; Personal innovativeness; Psychology; Extended model; Scholarly publishing,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how attitudes, norms (injunctive and descriptive) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) (capacity and autonomy) influence the intention to publish open access (OA), and how personal innovativeness in information technology affects attitude and PBC. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs an integrated and extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework within a cross-sectional survey design. The sample consists of researchers at a Norwegian university, and data are collected digitally via e-mail invitation and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - This study determines that attitude is the strongest predictor of the intention to publish OA, followed by injunctive and descriptive social norms, and PBC capacity and autonomy. All factors positively influence intention apart from PBC autonomy, which has a negative effect. Research limitations/implications - Potential limitations include: a relatively small sample size, self-reported data and employing intention, not behavior, as the ultimate dependent variable. Practical implications - This research contributes with a deeper understanding of what drives the intention to publish OA research articles, and how innovativeness affects attitudes and PBC autonomy. Support is found for an extended TPB model with decomposed normative and PBC components. This knowledge is essential in creating an impetus for systematic research on OA publishing behavior. Originality/value - Theory-driven research into understanding OA publishing behavior is rare. Decomposing the normative and PBC constructs is uncommon in TPB research, and a novel approach in OA research.

1801,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,From closed to open access: A case study of flipped journals,0,"In recent years, increased stakeholder pressure to transition research to Open Access has led to many journals ‘flipping’ from a toll access to an open access publishing model. Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. The aim of this paper is to show changes in the number of published articles and citations after the flipping of a journal. We analysed a set of 171 journals in the Web of Science (WoS) which flipped to open access. In addition to comparing the number of articles, average relative citation (ARC) and normalized impact factor (IF) are applied, respectively, as bibliometric indicators at the article and journal level, to trace the transformation of flipped journals covered. Our results show that flipping mostly has had positive effects on journal's IF. But it has had no obvious citation advantage for the articles. We also see a decline in the number of published articles after flipping. We can conclude that flipping to open access can improve the performance of journals, despite decreasing the tendency of authors to submit their articles and no better citation advantages for articles.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Momeni F., Mayr P., Fraser N., Peters I.",,,,,,"17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2019 - Proceedings",English,Conference Paper,"17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2019",2 September 2019 through 5 September 2019,0,,,,,0,International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics,0,9788833811185,2019,1,0,1270,1275,,,,,,2021-01-27

1803,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,In an Age of Open Access to Research Policies: Physician and Public Health NGO Staff Research Use and Policy Awareness,,"Introduction Through funding agency and publisher policies, an increasing proportion of the health sciences literature is being made open access. Such an increase in access raises questions about the awareness and potential utilization of this literature by those working in health fields. Methods A sample of physicians (N=336) and public health non-governmental organization (NGO) staff (N=92) were provided with relatively complete access to the research literature indexed in PubMed, as well as access to the point-of-care service UpToDate, for up to one year, with their usage monitored through the tracking of web-log data. The physicians also participated in a one-month trial of relatively complete or limited access. Results The study found that participants' research interests were not satisfied by article abstracts alone nor, in the case of the physicians, by a clinical summary service such as UpToDate. On average, a third of the physicians viewed research a little more frequently than once a week, while two-thirds of the public health NGO staff viewed more than three articles a week. Those articles were published since the 2008 adoption of the NIH Public Access Policy, as well as prior to 2008 and during the maximum 12-month embargo period. A portion of the articles in each period was already open access, but complete access encouraged a viewing of more research articles. Conclusion Those working in health fields will utilize more research in the course of their work as a result of (a) increasing open access to research, (b) improving awareness of and preparation for this access, and (c) adjusting public and open access policies to maximize the extent of potential access, through reduction in embargo periods and access to pre-policy literature.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=med,t=other,geo=USA,,,"Moorhead, Laura L.; Holzmeyer, Cheryl; Maggio, Lauren A.; Steinberg, Ryan M.; Willinsky, John",,,,J,,PLOS ONE,English,Article,,,,,"[Moorhead, Laura L.; Holzmeyer, Cheryl; Willinsky, John] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Maggio, Lauren A.; Steinberg, Ryan M.] Stanford Univ, Lane Med Lib, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,26,10,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,2015,10,7,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0129708,,,,26200794,2021-01-27

Presence of funding, collaboration and impact",Open access; Funding acknowledgements; Collaboration; Impact; Research fields; WoS,"Open access (OA) to every research result supported by funding bodies is a medium to long-term goal. This work aims to find out whether OA publication is useful for all research fields, regardless of their specific features. As a sample, articles from the WoS databases from two disparate disciplines (one from SSCI and another from SCIE) are selected, and several hypotheses related to the presence of funding acknowledgements, cooperation and citations are tested. A first look at the general distribution of publications shows that collaborative and funded research obtains a higher proportion of cited articles, and that this proportion increases in the case of OA publications. Moreover, the logistic regression reveals that the probability of finding an OA publication is significantly increased in the SCIE discipline, and by the presence of EU funding, international collaboration and citations. This probability rises with some interactions (e.g. presence of international funding and international collaboration, or international funding and citations). Regarding OA types, Green OA publications are the most related to fund recognition, although Gold OA/Bronze OA articles in international collaboration are also significantly related to financing. Concerning impact, the most likely cited OA type is the Hybrid OA. However, if papers include funding acknowledgements, the Bronze OA and Green OA publications increase their citation likelihood. Similarly, when Gold OA articles include international collaboration, there is a greater chance of citation. With these findings, it is possible to venture that OA publishing will be useful for all research fields, although their specific features should be considered. Consequently, funders should be aware of these particularities to stimulate OA without compromising the quality of the research.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=socscie; d=med,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Morillo, Fernanda",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Morillo, Fernanda] CSIC, IFS, Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain",,29,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,125,1,689,716,10.1007/s11192-020-03652-w,,,,,2021-01-27

Most of these journals do not charge article processing charges (APCs). This article reports the results of a survey of the 2567 journals, or 26% of journals listed in DOAJ, that do have APCs based on a sample of 1432 of these journals. Results indicate a volatile sector that would make future APCs difficult to predict for budgeting purposes. DOAJ and publisher title lists often did not closely match. A number of journals were found on examination not to have APCs. A wide range of publication costs was found for every publisher type. The average (mean) APC of $964 contrasts with a mode of $0. At least 61% of publishers using APCs are commercial in nature, while many publishers are of unknown types. The vast majority of journals charging APCs (80%) were found to offer one or more variations on pricing, such as discounts for authors from mid to low income countries, differential pricing based on article type, institutional or society membership, and/or optional charges for extras such as English language editing services or fast track of articles.

1815,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,Open-access clinical trial registries: the Italian scenario,Clinical trials registry;  Citizen;  Information,"Background: Citizens, patients and their representatives are increasingly insisting on working with health professionals to organize and discuss research protocols. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recommended setting up a public clinical trial registry where anyone can find key information about a trial. Around the world, governments have, in fact, now begun to legislate mandatory disclosure of all clinical trials. The aims of the present survey were to assess the availability of clinical trial registries for Italian citizens and to examine the transparency of the data items reported. Methods: The availability of open-access clinical trial registries was surveyed on a sample of 182 websites, including research institutes and centers of excellence (IRCCS-teaching hospitals), hospitals and associations. For each registry we downloaded a sample of two trials to assess the correspondence of the data items reported. Results from the Italian and international registries were compared. Results: Fifteen percent of the sample had an open-access registry of clinical trials. Comparison of the data items available, in terms of completeness and transparency, from institutional and international registries indicated wide variability. Conclusions: Italian citizens, patients and their associations have scant access to local registries of clinical trials, and international registries are generally more informative. On the European level, advocacy and lobby actions are needed among citizens and patients to boost the diffusion of open-access clinical trial registries without language barriers, thereby facilitating participation, access to information, and the coordination of clinical research.",a=opendata,m=interview,d=med,t=university,geo=Italy,,,"Mosconi, Paola;  Roberto, Anna",,,,J,,TRIALS,English,Article,,,,,"[Mosconi, Paola;  Roberto, Anna] Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Lab Med Res & Consumer Involvement, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,27,2,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,1745-6215,,2012,13,,,,10.1186/1745-6215-13-194,,,,23075149,2021-01-27

Design/methodology/approach - Given the exploratory nature of the research a two-phase qualitative approach was adopted. The first phase comprised 11 in-depth interviews to examine the universities' internal and external attributes that directly enhance the rate of adoption of the open access online education service. The second phase involved three focus groups examining students' perceptions of the innovation attributes as well as the likelihood that they would adopt the innovation. Findings - The results indicate that, besides the perceived attributes of the innovation being the main determinant of the students' adoption of it, a number of internal factors within the university and external factors within the educational market in Egypt directly influence the adoption process. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is in its empirical work as it adapted a well-known theory, the perceived attributes of innovation model, and empirically tested it in a specific context: the higher education market in a developing country.",a=openeducation,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=university,geo=EGY,year not completely clear,,"Mourad, Maha",,,,J,,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,English,Article,,,,,"Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Business, Dept Management, New Cairo, Egypt",,37,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,1468-4527,,2010,34,4,604,617,10.1108/14684521011073007,,,,,2021-01-27

Using The Munin Repository at UiT The Arctic University of Norway as a case study, a survey was conducted among the UiT researchers to examine their attitudes and practices towards the repository and towards open access (OA) publications. Methods. The survey questionnaire was sent to all employees at UiT between August and October 2016, but only academic staff in research positions, including PhD students, were selected for the analysis. 200 researchers responded to the survey. Results. The study found that researchers are supportive of the principle of OA but are less keen on contributing to their institutional repositories for a range of reasons. These include the process being quite a hassle, academics' uncertainty over certain legal, copyright and peer review issues, prestige issues, and uncertainty over the appropriate version to deposit or self-archive. Contribution. The statistical results can be used by readers as benchmarks to compare with their own institution's figures. Conclusively, the study found that more than 90% of the researchers agreed with the OA principles, but still 54% of UiT researchers did not archive their research documents in The Munin Repository.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=NOR,,,"Msomphora, Mbachi Ruth",,,,J,,LIBRES-LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH ELECTRONIC JOURNAL,English,Article,,,,,"[Msomphora, Mbachi Ruth] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Tromso, Norway",,40,0,NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIV LIBRARY,1058-6768,,2019,29,1,14,36,,,,,,2021-01-27

Comprehensive Cross-sectional Study of Exclusively Open-Access Surgical Journals,surgical research; open access; h-index; SCImago journal rank indicator; eigenfactor; journal impact,"OBJECTIVES: As open-access journals have become increasingly common, it has provided more options for researchers to publish their work and improved access of information to the public. However, some open access journals charge the authors processing fee on submission. In certain cases, this can be rather expensive. This study is the first study to specifically assess the cost of publishing in exclusively open-access, peer reviewed surgical journals, and their correlation with journal impact, in the form of 6 bibliometrics. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a cross-sectional study. A list of journals is compiled using the SCImago Journal & Country Rank and Directory of Open Access Journals. 6 indices are measured - impact factor, SCOPUS h-index, SCImago journal rank indicator (SJR), Eigenfactor, Article Influence Score and Google h5 index. The cost of publication (in USD$) of a research article (maximum of 6 pages) is used as a baseline. RESULTS: 89 research journals are included. The median cost of publication is USD$100 (range [0-2580]). 47% are free of charge. 13% can cost more than USD$2000 per article. SJR and Google h5 index appear to be the only indices that correlate linearly with the cost (p = 0.015 and 0.041, respectively), although the correlations are weak. 3 indices, namely impact factor, SJR and Article Influence Score appear to have very strong correlations with each other (Pearson coefficient > 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: From this study, the cost of publishing in open-access journals bears little correlation to their impact; this poses a dilemma for researchers without significant funding. Therefore, authors and funders must consider cautiously when submitting to these journals. (Crown Copyright 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

This moment of change-in which science turns inward to examine its methods and practices-provides an opportunity to address its historic lack of diversity and noninclusive culture. Through network modeling and semantic analysis, we provide an initial exploration of the structure, cultural frames, and women's participation in the open science and reproducibility literatures (n = 2,926 articles and conference proceedings). Network analyses suggest that the open science and reproducibility literatures are emerging relatively independently of each other, sharing few common papers or authors. We next examine whether the literatures differentially incorporate collaborative, prosocial ideals that are known to engage members of underrepresented groups more than independent, winner-takes-all approaches. We find that open science has a more connected, collaborative structure than does reproducibility. Semantic analyses of paper abstracts reveal that these literatures have adopted different cultural frames: open science includes more explicitly communal and prosocial language than does reproducibility. Finally, consistent with literature suggesting the diversity benefits of communal and prosocial purposes, we find that women publish more frequently in high-status author positions (first or last) within open science (vs. reproducibility). Furthermore, this finding is further patterned by team size and time. Women are more represented in larger teams within reproducibility, and women's participation is increasing in open science over time and decreasing in reproducibility. We conclude with actionable suggestions for cultivating a more prosocial and diverse culture of science.",a=openaccess; a=openmethod,m=biblio; m=other,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,"bibliographic search was on keywords “open science” and “reproducibility”;

There is limited information about the extent to which open access policies have been adopted by radiology journals. We performed a systematic analysis to ascertain the proportion of radiology journals with open access options. Materials and Methods: A search was performed with the assistance of a clinical informationist. Full and mixed English-language diagnostic and interventional radiology Web of Science journals (impact factors > 1.0) were included. Nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, physics, and solicitation-only journals were excluded. Primary outcome was open access option (yes or no) with additional outcomes including presence or absence of embargo, complete or partial copyright transfer, publication fees, and self-archiving policies. Secondary outcomes included journal citations, journal impact factors, immediacy, Eigenfactor, and article influence scores. Independent double readings were performed with differences resolved by consensus, supplemented by contacting editorial staff at each journal. Results: In all, 125 journals were identified; review yielded 49 journals (39%, mean impact factor of 2.61). Thirty-six of the journals had open access options (73.4%), and four journals were exclusively open access (8.2%). Twelve-month embargoes were most commonly cited (90.6%) with 28.6% of journals stating that they did not require a complete transfer of copyright. Prices for open access options ranged from $750 to $4,000 (median $3,000). No statistically significant differences were found in journal impact measures comparing journals with open access options to journals without open access options.

This paper presents the issues and challenges faced by a university library in encouraging academics and researchers to adopt open access, specifically with respect to depositing publications in the institutional repository Method. Interviews were conducted with academics and researchers about their awareness of open access and their use of the university repository. An action research approach was used to address issues on a continual basis, and redesign the repository based on the findings. Analysis. The interview data were analysed using thematic content analysis, and the repository data were analysed using heuristic evaluation Results. Results show that researchers lack awareness of open access and its value, and that there is also confusion about publishers' copyright policies and researcher reputation. The lack of visibility and usability of the library-managed institutional repository was found to be an issue, as well as the need for subject repositories. The results informed a redesign of the repository and informed the library's strategies to promote scholarly communication literacy. Conclusion. Whilst librarians have been advocates of open access, researchers' understanding of it is still limited;  they have other pressures in regard to their publishing outputs, which also limits their adoption of open access practices.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=hum;  d=socscie;  ,t=researcher,geo=NZL,,,"Narayan, Bhuva;  Luca, Edward",,,,J,,INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL,English,Article;  Proceedings Paper,"Conference on Research Applications, Information and Library Studies (RAILS)","DEC 06-08, 2016","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND",,"[Narayan, Bhuva] UTS, Sch Commun, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia;  [Luca, Edward] Univ Sydney Lib, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia",,51,2,UNIV SHEFFIELD DEPT INFORMATION STUDIES,1368-1613,,2017,22,4,,,,,,,,2021-01-27

Additionally, publishing databases were searched to obtain general statistics on veterinary publishing. A survey of institutional initiatives to promote open-access journals and institutional repositories was also performed. Veterinary faculty published a total of 4,872 articles indexed by MEDLINE in 679 different journals. Of these articles, 1,334 (27%) were available as free full text and were published in 245 different journals. Although 51 veterinary-specific journals offering immediate and free full-text access were identified, few articles in this study appeared in these titles.

The study is based on a brief survey of literature and data collected from Web of Science ™-Core Collection, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR). This study also looks at India's position in the global Open Access in terms of its ranking with regards to the total OA Journals, total research output, OA gold papers. Study reveals that inspite of its relatively lower position in OA gold papers, India's position in terms of share of gold OA publications is relatively higher than other leading countries of the world. Some Government departments like University Grants Commission (UGC) and governing bodies of the major research councils, such as Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), have mandated OA and self-archiving for their journals. Despite the large amount of scholarly research literature produced in India, its position in terms of quality research is missing from the global stage, largely because most of the research literature is published in local journals, as well as the quality of research output is often below the global standard.

Design/methodology/approach Articles contributed by the researchers in IITs were searched using an advance search option in the Web of Science Core collection database. The search was restricted to journal articles published in English language in the year 2015. Of the 10,049 articles retrieved, 1,023 (10 per cent of the total) were chosen randomly. Articles selected after randomizations were exported to MS Excel for further analyses. Title of each article was searched in Google Scholar to assess its OA availability and venues used by the author for self-archiving. Details of ten articles could not be traced in Google Scholar, and they were excluded from the analysis. Based on the analysis of URLs, all OA articles were classified into three categories: gold OA, green OA and both gold and green OA. The OA articles available through green route were further classified into six categories based on the analysis of the websites and the self-archiving venues used by the authors: institutional repository, subject repository, researcher or scholar's website, organizational website, ResearchGate and other websites. Findings Of 1,013 articles examined, OA versions were found for 68.70 per cent of articles. Of the total OA articles, 10.26 per cent articles were available through gold OA and 58.44 per cent were available through green OA, while remaining 6.21 per cent were available via both gold and green OA routes. Although researchers use different venues for self-archiving their articles, ResearchGate and institutional repositories are the most preferred choices by the researchers in IITs. Researchers in IITs are seemed to be unaware of the self-archiving policies of publishers, as more than 85 per cent self-archived articles were found as final PDF versions that are normally not allowed by the publishers. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to IITs, but it offers theoretical implications for extending its scope to different subjects and institutes. The findings of the study may be useful for the publishers and institutions for formulating OA policies. The findings of the study might be used for raising awareness of OA among researchers and encouraging them to contribute their research outcome in OA outlets.

In order to analyse the availability of OA research literature in the field of digital library, a search was conducted on Web of Science's Core collection database on June 11, 2019. In response to a topic search TS = Digital Library using the advanced search option, 849 articles were retrieved. Of the 849 articles examined, the details of 26 articles were not found in the Google Scholar. Therefore, 823 articles were selected for further analyses. After examining the Websites of OA articles, they were classified into three categories: gold OA, green OA, and both gold and green OA. Furthermore, all the green OA articles were systematically organised into six groups for the examination of the self-archiving venues used by the researchers for self-archiving. Out of 823 articles analysed, OA versions were found for 64.76 per cent of articles. This study found that 26.68 per cent of OA articles were available through gold OA and 60.39 per cent articles were available through green OA, while 36.53 per cent articles were accessible via both OA journals and self-archiving (gold & green OA). Although researchers used various OA platforms for self-archiving of their research work, publishers' Websites were found as the most preferred choice for self-archiving of research work by the authors in the field of digital library.

1877,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,Balancing ideology and feasibility: A case study on adopting and evaluating open access publishing models for a society journal within philosophy,0,"Introduction. Open access, the notion that research output, such as journal articles, should be freely accessible to readers on the Web, is arguably in the best interest of science. In this article, we (1) describe in-depth how a society-owned philosophy journal, Nordic Wittgenstein Review, evaluated various publishing models and made an informed decision on how best to adopt open access publishing for the journal, and (2) develop and implement measures to evaluate the chosen model. Method. This case study uses reports from editorial board members (mainly the editor-in-chief), Web access metrics as well as a Web survey to the journal community as well as the wider philosophy research community. Analysis. After two years as a delayed open access journal with commercial publishers, the journal made a decision to become an independent scholar-run journal without fees to readers or authors, and which would rely mainly on volunteer effort with university faculty support. This decision was made after evaluating various publishing scenarios and negotiating with potential publishers. This study breaks down what is involved in terms of input and effort compared to having handed over the publishing of the journal to an external publisher. Conclusions. For an open access journal choosing between publishing models, elements of ideology and feasibility need to be balanced. This article provides an overview of relevant elements and some means to judge feasibility in journal publishing endeavours. © the authors, 2017.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=hum,t=publisher,geo=NOR; geo=SWE; geo=DEN; geo=FIN,,,"Neuman Y., Laakso M.",,,,,,Information Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,2,University of Sheffield,13681613,0,2017,22,4,0,0,,,,,,2021-01-27

Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire survey was administered on behalf of Ciber by NOP and the sample derived from mailing lists supplied by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI (R)). Nearly, 4,000 authors responded. Findings - The detailed results of a major survey of the views and experiences of nearly 4,000 senior authors in regard to OA publishing. A number of statistical analyses were employed to drill down into the data to obtain an understanding of the figures. Views were divided sharply along subject and geographical lines, demonstrating the need to survey large and robust samples of authors.

A major objective was to examine the impact of open access in the context of other initiatives that have improved accessibility to scholarly journals. The study also aims to demonstrate the potential of deep log analysis for monitoring change in usage over time. Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered from the logs for the period 2003-June 2005 and analysed using deep log methods. The data were analysed to provide the following information on use: type of item viewed; usage over time; usage for individual journal issues; usage per type of article; age of article. Usage analyses were further examined with regard to the following user characteristics: subscriber/non-subscriber; referrer link employed, organisational affiliation; geographical location. Findings - The analysis showed that the rise in use of NAR over the survey period (140 per cent) could largely be attributed to the opening up of the site to search engines and that the move to OA had a relatively small influence on driving usage up further (less than 10 per cent).

We examined implementation in a randomly selected cross-sectional sample of 201 articles published in 2017 in the best practice journals, defined as having explicit supportive policies in 4 out of 5 domains. Our findings showed that 15 journals cited prospective registration. 40 data sharing, 15 explicitly permitted preprints, 28 endorsed reporting guidelines, and 52 had mandatory policies for COI disclosure. Except for COI disclosure, few policies were mandatory: registration in 15 journals, data sharing in 1, and reporting guidelines for randomized trials in 18 and for meta-analyses in 15. Seventeen journals were identified as best practice. An analysis of recent articles showed extremely low compliance for prospective registration (3% articles) and data sharing (2%). One preprint could be identified. Reporting guidelines were endorsed in 19% of the articles, though for most articles this domain was rated as nonapplicable.

1905,SCOPUS,jana_lasser,Publishing habits and perceptions of open access publishing and public access amongst clinical and research fellows,0,"Introduction: Open access (OA) publishing rates have risen dramatically in the biomedical sciences in the past decade. However, few studies have focused on the publishing activities and attitudes of early career researchers. The aim of this study was to examine current publishing activities of clinical and research fellows and their perceptions of OA publishing and public access. Methods: This study employed a mixed methods approach. Data on publications authored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fellows between 2013 and 2018 were collected via an in-house author profile system and citation indexes. Journals were categorized according to SHERPA/RoMEO classifications. In-person and telephone interviews were conducted with fifteen fellows to discern their perceptions of OA publishing. Results: The total percentage of fellows’ publications that were freely available OA was 28.6%, with a relatively flat rate between 2013 and 2018. Publications with fellows as first authors were significantly more likely to be OA. Fellows cited high article processing charges (APCs) and perceived lack of journal quality or prestige as barriers to OA publishing. Fellows generally expressed support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) public access policy. Conclusions: While the fellows in this study acknowledged the potential of OA to aid in research dissemination, they also expressed hesitation to publish OA related to confusion surrounding legitimate OA and predatory publications and frustration with APCs. Fellows supported the NIH public access policy and accepted it as part of their research process. Health sciences information professionals could potentially leverage this acceptance of public access to advocate for OA publishing. © 2020, Medical Library Association.

Consequently, three objectives were set out for the study. The descriptive survey design was employed and the questionnaire entitled Attitude towards Open Access to Scholarly Publications Questionnaire (AOASPQ) was administered on the entire population of 141 LIS lecturers from which 114 responses were successfully collected. The data collected were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, mean and regression analysis. The study revealed that though the level of usage of open access publications by both senior and junior LIS lecturers is high, usage by junior lecturers are a bit higher. That notwithstanding, both cadre of lecturers exhibit similar positive attitude towards open access publications and this situation was found to account for 20.20% of their tendency to use open access publications. The study recommends that management should equip schools with the enabling infrastructure and that academic reward systems should be designed to encourage open access publications.

1913,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Study of Predatory Open Access Nursing Journals,Editorial standards; ethical issues; nursing journals; predatory journals; publishing,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify predatory journals in nursing, describe their characteristics and editorial standards, and document experiences of authors, peer reviewers, and editors affiliated with these journals. Design: Using two sources that list predatory journals, the research team created a list of nursing journals. In Phase One, the team collected data on characteristics of predatory nursing journals such as types of articles published, article processing charge, and peer review process. In Phase Two, the team surveyed a sample of authors, reviewers, and editors to learn more about their experiences with their affiliated journals. Methods: Data from the review of predatory nursing journals were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Written comments were summarized and categorized. Findings: There were 140 predatory nursing journals from 75 publishers. Most journals were new, having been inaugurated in the past 1 to 2 years. One important finding was that many journals only published one or two volumes and then either ceased publishing or published fewer issues and articles after the first volume. Journal content varied widely, and some journals published content from dentistry and medicine, as well as nursing. Qualitative findings from the surveys confirmed previously published anecdotal evidence, including authors selecting journals based on spam emails and inability to halt publication of a manuscript, despite authors’ requests to do so. Conclusions: Predatory journals exist in nursing and bring with them many of the “red flags” that have been noted in the literature, including lack of transparency about editorial processes and misleading information promoted on websites. The number of journals is high enough to warrant concern in the discipline about erosion of our scholarly literature. Clinical Relevance: Nurses rely on the published literature to provide evidence for high-quality, safe care that promotes optimal patient outcomes. Research published in journals that do not adhere to the highest standards of publishing excellence have the potential to compromise nursing scholarship and is an area of concern. © 2016 Sigma Theta Tau International",a=openaccess,m=survey; m=biblio,d=med,t=researcher; t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Oermann M.H., Conklin J.L., Nicoll L.H., Chinn P.L., Ashton K.S., Edie A.H., Amarasekara S., Budinger S.C.",,,,,,Journal of Nursing Scholarship,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,48,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,15276546,0,2016,48,6,624,632,10.1111/jnu.12248,,,,,2021-01-27

Open science enhances collaborations and sharing of resources among researchers. Metadata related activities are more prevalent due to open science. Open science has increased the relevance of science to our environment and world issues like privacy and the rightful author of scientific data are still some of the challenges facing open science.

1920,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Predatory publishing or a lack of peer review transparency?—a contemporary analysis of indexed open and non-open access articles in paediatric urology,Citation; Impact Factor; Open Access; Predatory; Pseudojournal; Publishing,"Introduction: The advent of open access publishing has allowed for unrestricted and rapid knowledge dissemination and can generate higher citation levels. However, the establishment of predatory journals exploits this model and may lead to publication of non-peer reviewed work. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics and trends of indexed publications in paediatric urology. The primary outcomes were to compare open access vs non-open access publishing. The secondary outcome was to assess whether any open access publications in this cohort could be classified as predatory based on journal data basing and external peer review policies. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase reviews were carried out for any publication using the terms ‘p(a)ediatric urology’ over a 5-year period (October 2012–2017). These publications were individually accessed, assessed for relevance and cross-checked using the ISI Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Report. Bibliometric data, journal type and access model were all individually assessed, ranked and compared using descriptive and non-parametric statistical methods. Results: From an initial total of 4075 indexed publications, 2244 journal publications across 51 countries were included based on relevance, of which 611 were open access. Open access journals were significantly more likely to publish basic science/laboratory versus clinical publications (10.9% vs 3.3%). They were more likely have higher average citations/publication (17 vs. 8), but there was no difference between open and closed journal impact factors (3.1 vs. 2.7). The overall rate of open access, indexed publications that were not peer reviewed and/or included in open access databases was 6.5% Discussion: The overall numbers of paediatric urological articles appearing on PubMed between 2012 and 2017 have increased by approximately 75%, while the number of open access articles has remained relatively static (25%). Researchers may prefer to publish in specific journals to disseminate results to a particular audience or fear in the current climate that an open access journal may not be considered legitimate, and possibly even predatory, thus having a negative impact on the data and the author's reputation. The impact factor status and route/method of publication may be less important. Conclusions: Open access, peer reviewed publishing allows rapid international knowledge dissemination. The exact objective definition of what constitutes a predatory journal remains controversial. We have identified a time-stable prevalence of 6.5% open access publications that could meet proposed criteria for a ‘borderline/predatory journal’; however, this should not influence the decision to publish in open access journals. © 2019 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=med,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"O'Kelly F., Fernandez N., Koyle M.A.",,,,,,Journal of Pediatric Urology,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,2,Elsevier Ltd,14775131,0,2019,15,2,159.e1,159.e7,10.1016/j.jpurol.2018.08.019,,,,,2021-01-27

These include Open Access repositories, Open Access journals, or hybrid publishing. For some years, researchers have been using new ways to communicate and share their work by using academic social networks. In an attempt to foster the development of Open Access in France, the French consortium COUPERIN (Unified Consortium of Higher Education and Research Organizations for Access to Numerical Publications) proposed that academic social networks could be used to convince researchers of becoming more involved in Open Access. To test this hypothesis, a nationwide survey was launched in 2014 to explore whether and how these academic social networks are used to share content, but also how they compare to other Open Access classic tools. Within a month (20 May to 20 June), 1,898 researchers answered this 28-question survey. It was fully completed by 1,698 of them. This provides COUPERIN with considerable data for analysis. The respondents roughly reflect the composition of the French academic community in terms of gender and research fields, with a slight overrepresentation of young researchers/PhD candidates. This survey does not, however, cover the in-depth opinions of researchers on Open Access and academic social networks. It therefore only presents general tendencies. Nonetheless, the survey gives many indications as to how researchers apply Open Access. In addition, it shows how they feel about the usefulness of these networks compared to repositories when efficiently disseminating their work. This survey also takes the differences between disciplines into account and characterizes behaviour and opinions according to the different disciplinary communities and their research practices. Finally, this survey allows us to define the main characteristics of a tool which could meet French researchers’ needs for scientific communication. The components of such an ideal tool dedicated to Open Science could include efficient repositories to easily disseminate work and improve visibility, a sharing network and the scientific stamp of peer-review. © the Author(s).",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=FRA,,,Okret-Manville C.,,,,,,LIBER Quarterly,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,"Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services",14355205,0,2016,25,3,118,135,10.18352/lq.10131,,,,,2021-01-27
1922,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Whose infrastructure? Towards inclusive and collaborative knowledge infrastructures in open science,Collaboration; Inclusive knowledge infrastructures; Intersectionality; Open science; Participatory design; Research tools,"The current discourse around Open Science has tended to focus on the creation of new technological platforms and tools to facilitate sharing and reuse of a wide range of research outputs. There is an assumption that once these new tools are in place, researchers-and at times, members of the general public-will be able to participate in the creation of scientific knowledge in more accessible and efficient ways. While many of these new tools have indeed assisted in the ease of collaboration through online spaces and mechanisms, the narrowness of how infrastructure is imagined by open science practitioners tends to put the use of technology ahead of the issues that people are actually trying to solve and fails to acknowledge the systemic constraints that exist within and between some communities. Drawing on an analytical framework grounded in Black feminist intersectionality (Noble 2016), this paper highlights the need for more inclusive knowledge infrastructures, particularly in the context of sustainable development. Three case studies from the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet), are outlined in order to illustrate the importance of moving beyond a definition of infrastructure as merely a technical or physical entity. These cases, arising from research conducted in South Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean, demonstrate how more sustainable and nuanced forms of collaboration and participation may be enabled through broader understandings of knowledge infrastructures. This paper further argues that leveraging the feminist concept of intersectionality when conceptualizing the development of knowledge infrastructures could be one way to move from narrow assumptions about standardized knowledge “users” towards more inclusive reimaginings of how knowledges can be produced and shared via networked technologies. © 22nd International Conference on Electronic Publishing - Connecting the Knowledge Commons: From Projects to Sustainable Infrastructure, ELPUB 2018.

Qualitative interviews with scientific councillors show that they perceive their role as intermediaries between research and policy and focus their work on improving the quality of research commissioned by their ministry. This process, for them, involves using existing academic articles and datasets to which, however, they lack official access.

In this new trend so-called open science, we focus on collaborative work between citizens and scientists. In the present article, we call this collaboration crowd science. We hypothesized that an ideal collaborative relation can be developed from three elements: selections of appropriate topics of scientific projects, appropriate locations and opportunities for citizen-scientist interactions, and well-organized methodologies of the collaborations. To practice and develop this style of the crowd science, we have been organizing two annual workshops, the KYOTO Open Science Workshop in 2016 and 2017. The workshops were held at MTRL KYOTO outside universities, and were designed both for researchers and citizens. In the second workshop in 2017, we employed so-called ideathon technique to develop a survey project of alien slugs as an example. In the ideathon, participants proposed feasible plans to enhance the project, and researchers would not come up with such plans. Questionnaire results showed that 73% of participants had been motivated to the crowd science. We found that the above three fundamental elements induced citizens collaborative motivation to crowd science. We will continue this attempt to build a collaborative relationship between academic experts and citizens who participate in science. © 2017 IEEE.",a=openparticipation; a=openmethod,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=practitioner,geo=JPN,"added a=citizenscience, as none of the available categories fit.

Relevant data was extracted from the Data Citation Index (DCI) using an advanced search strategy, which was limited to the publication years between 2009 and 2014. Data was analysed to obtain the number of data records by country, institution, subject category, year of publication, and document type as well as the number of citations. A Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to gauge the relationship between the data records and research articles. Findings indicate that only 20 (out of 50) countries in sub-Saharan Africa produced at least one data record in the DCI, with South Africa leading the pack with 539 (61.39 %) records followed by Kenya, Cameroon and Ghana. SSA contributes a mere 0.03 % of the world's research data as compared to 1.4 % of the world's research articles. Research institutions and universities are the major contributors of research data, which largely focuses on Genetics and Heredity (61.3 %), Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (61.3 %), Agriculture (29.2 %) and Forestry (27.3 %).

The few studies conducted so far have been limited to very specific geographic areas (USA), which makes it necessary to find out what is happening in other regions that are not part of mainstream academia, and where repositories play a decisive role in the visibility of scholarly production. The main objective of this study is to ascertain the web presence and visibility of Latin American repositories in Google and Google Scholar through the application of page count and web mention indicators respectively. For a sample of 137 repositories, the results indicate that the indexing ratio is low in Google, and virtually nonexistent in Google Scholar;  they also indicate a complete lack of correspondence between the repository records and the data produced by these two search tools. These results are mainly attributable to limitations arising from the use of description schemas that are incompatible with Google Scholar (repository design) and the reliability of web mention indicators (search engines). We conclude that neither Google nor Google Scholar accurately represent the actual size of OA content published by Latin American repositories;  this may indicate a non-indexed, hidden side to OA, which could be limiting the dissemination and consumption of OA scholarly literature.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=NA; geo=SA,geo=Latinamerica,,"Orduna-Malea, Enrique;  Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Orduna-Malea, Enrique] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Grp EC3, Valencia 46022, Spain;  [Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio] Univ Granada, Res Grp EC3, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,44,12,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2015,102,1,829,846,10.1007/s11192-014-1369-5,,,,,2021-01-27

Making use of experience with, IraLIS (International Registry for Authors: Library and Information Science = Link, to Identify Scientists; http://www.iralis.org), this study examines how authorities are registered in two Spanish, OAI-PMH-compliant projects: Recercat and E-Prints Complutense. The authorities database of the two repositories analysed were downloaded. The style of signing - the recommended one should contain only two elements - was recorded by field of knowledge, using the topic classification systems of The Intute project and The ANEP agency. The most commonly used signing style involved two surnames (76% in Recercat and 94% in E-Prints Complutense). The social sciences showed the greatest adoption of the recommended signing style (20% of all records in this area). The adoption rate of the recommended signing style in both, repositories was low, especially in E-Prints Complutense. The index of the use of The recommended signing style by knowledge field reveals a true picture of these Open Access repositories. This information could allow awareness campaigns to be designed for different fields of knowledge. it might be thought that the most internationalised sciences and the authors of its literature would take signing style into account, but this does not seem to be the case. Indeed, The social sciences were those which most frequently followed the recommended system.

This article reports on the results of a national survey conducted in the summer of 2006 of academic librarians' attitudes toward open access principles and related behaviors. While attitude responses were largely positive, there were differences in levels of support related to respondents' job descriptions and funding of open access activities. Surveyed librarians appear to be more comfortable with tasks that translate traditionally held responsibilities, such as educating others, to the open access environment.

This study seeks to analyse and evaluate researchers' knowledge of open science in Colombia using a survey to determine adequate instruments with which to improve research in the framework of open science. The aim of the study is to determine researchers' current awareness of open science by considering demographic characteristics to analyse their attitudes, values, and information habits as well as the levels of institutionalism and social appropriation of open science. A representative sample of Colombian researchers was selected from the National Research System. An anonymous online survey consisting of 34 questions was sent to all professors and researchers at Colombian universities and research institutes. Sampling was random and stratified, which allowed for a representative sample of different categories of researchers, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used for the sample design. A total of 1042 responses were received, with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 3%. The majority of respondents knew about open science, especially in relation to open science tools (software, repositories, and networks) and open data. Researchers consider open science to be positively impacted by factors such as the rise of digital technologies, the search for new forms of collaboration, the greater availability of open data and information, and public demand for better and more effective science. In contrast, a lack of resources to develop research activities within the open science approach and the limited integration between traditional and open science are identified as the most important barriers to its use in research.

1966,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Exploring the willingness of scholars to accept open access: A grounded theory approach,0,"This article aims to explore what factors increase or decrease scholars’ willingness to publish and use articles in open-access journals and discusses how these factors are related to one another. Research-oriented publications on the topic of open-access journals have been few, and there is widespread concern about whether scholars will adopt this new form of scholarly communication. The growing number of open-access journals leads scholars to encounter decision-making situations in which they must choose one journal among multiple alternatives, including open access and non-open access. We conducted open-ended and semi-structured in-depth interviews with eight faculty members and six doctoral students at Syracuse University. Based on the interview transcripts, willingness factors and their relationships were identified and refined using the iterative steps of grounded theory approach proposed by Strauss and Corbin in the 1998 edition of their Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory. The findings show seven factors (perceived journal reputation, perceived topical relevance, perceived availability, perceived career benefit, perceived cost, perceived content quality, and perceived ease of use) and eight relationships. There were six positive and two negative relationships. The factors and relationships were then compared to the relevant literature to increase internal validity and generalizability of the study. Both theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed. Theoretically, this study broadens the scope of relevance criteria studies, first identifies the relationship between two important scholarly communication activities, conceptually contributes to the concept of open access, and applies literature comparison methodology in a pure qualitative study to 182increase internal validity and generalizability. Practically, the findings of this study may be helpful for promoting open-access publishing by encouraging facilitators and discouraging hinderers. The research may also provide an ongoing working framework for evaluating open-access journal systems. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis.

METHODS: We evaluated the association between open access publishing and citation number in 2017 among 4 major cardiovascular journals. Articles indexed to PubMed with >= 5 citations were identified among the following journals: Circulation, European Heart Journal, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, and JAMA Cardiology. Multivariable Poisson regression models were adjusted for journal and article type. RESULTS: Of the 16 articles published in 2017, original investigations accounted for most articles (66.7%), followed by reviews (14.5%), guideline/scientific statements (8.4%), research letters (3.7%), viewpoints (3.7%), and editorials (2.9%). Among all articles, 43% (n = 391) were open access. Citation number was higher among open access articles compared with those with subscription access (14 [25th 75th percentile: 9-23] vs 11 [25th-75th percentile: 7-17]; P < .001). Open access status was significantly associated with higher number of citations after multivariable adjustment (beta coefficient: +0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.45, P < .001). Open access articles had consistently higher citations compared with subscription access articles across the 3 most frequent article types. CONCLUSION: Among contemporary articles published in major cardiovascular journals, open access publishing accounted for over 40% of articles and was significantly associated with increased short-term citations. Further research is required to assess the variation in long-term citation rates based on open access publishing status. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In order to do so, data from 930 journals and 63,847 documents were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. It was found that 59% of these documents were published in journals that charge APC. The total expenditures for the 5-year period were estimated at approximately USD 36million, the weighted average cost per document at USD 957.75 and the average cost per journal at USD 1492.27. The profile of these publications shows that journals indexed by SciELO represent 67% of the 63,847 documents. The use of mega-journals increased over the period, which implies an increase in expenditure in publications, since the average APC per journal was USD 2059.77.

As a follow-up to a similar survey conducted in 2013, the article also outlines the differences in beliefs about and engagement with open access that have occurred between 2013 and 2018. Although faculty in LIS schools are proponents of free access to research, journal publication choices remain informed by traditional considerations such as prestige and impact factor. Engagement with open access has increased significantly, while perceptions of open access have remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2018. Nonetheless, those faculty who have published in an open-access journal or are more knowledgeable about open access tend to be more convinced about the quality of open-access publications and less apprehensive about open-access publishing than those who have no publishing experience with open-access journals or who are less knowledgeable about various open-access modalities.

1995,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,An examination of North American Library and Information Studies faculty perceptions of and experience with open-access scholarly publishing,,"Open-access (OA) scholarly publishing has grown steadily in academia for the past few decades as an alternative to traditional, subscription-based journal publishing. This research presents the descriptive analysis of a systematic survey of North American library and information science (LIS) faculty about their attitudes toward and experience with OA publishing. The study reveals that LIS faculty tend to be more experienced with and knowledgeable about open access than their colleagues in other disciplines. A majority of LIS faculty is very critical of what is perceived to be detrimental control exercised by publishers over the scholarly communication system and agrees that major changes need to be made to this system. Although a majority of LIS faculty considers OA journals to be comparable to traditional journals, a sizable minority remains unconvinced of the purported benefits of open-access journals. The perceived constraints of the tenure and promotion system within the academy tend to limit LIS faculty engagement with open-access publishing in ways similar to other academic disciplines. There thus exists a disconnect between proclaimed support for and actual engagement with open access. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The study reveals that engagement with open access is related to faculty rank and perceptions about tenure and promotion committee assessments of open-access publications. The perceived constraints of the tenure and promotion system within the academy impact LIS faculty engagement with open-access publishing in ways found in other academic disciplines. However, those who themselves engage with open access tend to assess publications in such venues more favourably than those without such publishing experience and are similarly more predisposed to believe that tenure and promotion committees would evaluate such publications favourably. Nonetheless, while in general it is clear that experience with open access reduces some of the concerns about the effects of this type of scholarly publishing on career opportunities, there remains a substantial amount of equivocacy among LIS faculty about open access.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=librarian,geo=USA,same study as ID=1995?,,"Peekhaus, Wilhelm; Proferes, Nicholas",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Peekhaus, Wilhelm; Proferes, Nicholas] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Informat Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",,22,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,0165-5515,,2015,41,5,640,661,10.1177/0165551515587855,,,,,2021-01-27

The main objective is the assessment of the feasibility of the journal typologies with a special emphasis on the comparison of both the subscription-based and the Open Access models. The analysis is backed by the combination of data contained in four of the main bibliographic databases to offer comprehensive, new and updated data on OA (Sherpa-RoMEO, DOAJ, Web of Science and Scopus). A total of 18.3 million articles and reviews were analysed between 2005 and 2015. In the comparison of Web of Science and Scopus, we found that the proportion of OA publications is 5% inferior in WoS. The growth of the total number of documents published in Gold OA journals is noteworthy in the period analysed. However, the study of the proportion of publications and citations in both databases revealed that Gold OA journals only increased their proportion of publications but not the proportion of citations.

2036,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Medical research charities and open access,,"This paper provides an analysis of the attitudes and activities of UK medical research charities in relation to open access (OA). Both quantitative and qualitative data are presented derived from a recent survey of charities covering areas such as policy development, funding arrangements, and business process design for OA. Positions on key issues including green and gold OA, funding article-processing charges (APCs), and publication licences are assessed. Modelling of potential APCs as a percentage of overall annual research spend is undertaken to show possible costs of a charged for gold system. Medical research charities clearly regard OA as important and some see it as an opportunity to further their mission. However, many expressed significant concerns particularly about the costs and expertise required to support OA. Further co-ordination of policy development and action across the sector and with other stakeholders is recommended in order to help ensure optimal implementation of OA.

It identifies and discusses recent trends and future challenges for various stakeholders in delivering Open Access (OA) to the scholarly literature. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a number of interrelated strands of evidence which make up the current discourse on OA, comprising the peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and other forms of communication (including blogs and e-mail discussion lists). It uses a large-scale textual analysis of the peer-reviewed literature since 2010 (carried out using the VOSviewer tool) as a basis for discussion of issues raised in the OA discourse. Findings - A number of key themes are identified, including the relationship between Green OA (deposit in repositories) and Gold OA (OA journal publication), the developing evidence base associated with OA, researcher attitudes and behaviours, policy directions, management of repositories, development of journals, institutional responses and issues around impact and scholarly communication futures. It suggests that current challenges now focus on how OA can be made to work in practice, having moved on from the discussion of whether it should happen at all.

2039,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Researchers' Adoption of an Institutional Central Fund for Open-Access Article-Processing Charges: A Case Study Using Innovation Diffusion Theory,open access; article-processing charges; Gold OA; Innovation Diffusion Theory,"This article analyzes researchers' adoption of an institutional central fund (or faculty publication fund) for open-access (OA) article-processing charges (APCs) to contribute to a wider understanding of take-up of OA journal publishing (Gold OA). Quantitative data, recording central fund usage at the University of Nottingham from 2006 to 2014, are analyzed alongside qualitative data from institutional documentation. The importance of the settings of U.K. national policy developments and international OA adoption trends are considered. Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) is used as an explanatory framework. It is shown that use of the central fund grew during the period from covering less than 1% of the University's outputs to more than 12%. Health and Life Sciences disciplines made greatest use of the fund. Although highly variable, average APC prices rose during the period, with fully OA publishers setting lower average APCs. APCs were paid largely from internal funds, but external funding became increasingly important. Key factors in adoption are identified to be increasing awareness and changing perceptions of OA, communication, disciplinary differences, and adoption mandates. The study provides a detailed longitudinal analysis of one of the earliest central funds to be established globally with a theoretically informed explanatory model to inform future work on managing central funds and developing institutional and national OA policies.",a=openaccess,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=unisupportstaff,geo=GBR,,,"Pinfield, Stephen; Middleton, Christine",,,,J,,SAGE OPEN,English,Article,,,,,"[Pinfield, Stephen] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, 211 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England; [Middleton, Christine] Univ Nottingham, Dept Libraries & Res & Learning Resources, Nottingham, England",,59,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,2158-2440,,2016,6,1,,,10.1177/2158244015625447,,,,,2021-01-27
2040,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,The total cost of publication in a hybrid open-access environment: Institutional approaches to funding journal article-processing charges in combination with subscriptions,open-access publications; scholarly publishing; subscriptions,"As open-access (OA) publishing funded by article-processing charges (APCs) becomes more widely accepted, academic institutions need to be aware of the total cost of publication (TCP), comprising subscription costs plus APCs and additional administration costs. This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007-2014 modeling the TCP. It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward, with payments projected to increase further. As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing, these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing (Gold OA). Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable, there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007. In particular, hybrid subscription/OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals. Most APCs were paid to large traditional commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income. New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably. The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions, in 2013 already constituting an average of 10% of the TCP (excluding administrative costs).",a=openaccess,m=other,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=GBR,,,"Pinfield, Stephen; Salter, Jennifer; Bath, Peter A.",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Pinfield, Stephen; Salter, Jennifer; Bath, Peter A.] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Regent Court, 211 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England",,48,59,WILEY,2330-1635,,2016,67,7,1751,1766,10.1002/asi.23446,,,,,2021-01-27

There are several calls now that not only persuade researchers to publish in OA journals, to archive their pre- or post-print versions of papers in repositories, but also institutions and funding agencies to promote OA of research publications. This article examines OA levels and patterns in research output by computationally analysing research publication data obtained from the Web of Science for India during the last five years (2014-2018). Results obtained show that about 24% of research output from India, during the last five years, is available in OA compared to world average of about 30%. More articles are available in gold OA compared to green and bronze OA. Furthermore, OA levels vary in different disciplines, with medical science, physics and biology having higher percentage of their articles available as OA as compared to those like arts and humanities, social science and (surprisingly) information science.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=IND,I couldn't access the article,,"Piryani, Rajesh; Dua, Jyoti; Singh, Vivek Kumar",,,,J,,CURRENT SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Piryani, Rajesh] South Asian Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Delhi 110021, India; [Dua, Jyoti; Singh, Vivek Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",,15,3,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,0011-3891,,2019,117,9,1435,1440,10.18520/cs/v117/i9/1435-1440,,,,,2021-01-27
2049,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Data reuse and the open data citation advantage,Data reuse; Data repositories; Gene expression microarray; Incentives; Data archiving; Open data; Bibliometrics; Information science,"Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the citation benefit. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9% (95% confidence interval: 5% to 13%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.",a=opendata,m=biblio,d=natscie,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Piwowar, Heather A.; Vision, Todd J.",,,,J,,PEERJ,English,Article,,,,,"[Piwowar, Heather A.; Vision, Todd J.] Natl Evolutionary Synth Ctr, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Piwowar, Heather A.; Vision, Todd J.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Vision, Todd J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,33,177,PEERJ INC,2167-8359,,2013,1,,,,10.7717/peerj.175,,,,24109559,2021-01-27

We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA.

Material and methods: All data for this study were obtained from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank database. We compared the change in the mean annual IFs of 197 SA journals with 52 OA journals in the field of orthopedics and sports medicine for the period between 1999 and 2017. In addition, we determined and compared the changes in the mean tri-annual IFs of these journals in 2011, 2014 and 2017. The mean publication fee values of the OA journals as well as the correlation between the three-year IFs of the year 2017 and the publication fee values were evaluated. Results: From 1999 to 2017, the mean IF of SA journals increased 0.47-fold to 0.69, while the mean IF of the OA journals increased 0.85-fold to 0.63. Significant positive correlation was observed between the tri-annual IF and publication fee of OA journals in 2017 (r=0.458, p=0.001).

2058,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Open access publishing trend analysis: Statistics beyond the perception,0,"Introduction. The purpose of this analysis was twofold: to track the number of open access journals acquiring impact factor, and to investigate the distribution of subject categories pertaining to these journals. As a case study, journals in which the researchers of the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) in Italy have published were surveyed. Method. Data were collected by searching open access journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals) then compared with those having an impact factor as tracked by the Journal Citation Reports for the years 2010-2012. Journal Citation Reports subject categories were matched with Medical Subject Headings to provide a larger content classification. Analysis. A survey was performed to determine the Directory journals matching the Journal Citation Reports list, and their inclusion in a given subject area. Results. In the years 2010-2012, an increase in the number of journals was observed for Journal Citation Reports (+ 4.93%) and for the Directory (+18.51%). The discipline showing the highest increment was medicine (315 occurrences, 26%). Conclusions. From 2010 to 2012, the number of open access journals with impact factor has gradually risen, with a prevalence for journals relating to medicine and biological science disciplines, suggesting that authors prefer to publish more than before in open access journals. © 2016, Information Research.

2059,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Where on earth to publish? A sample survey comparing traditional and open access publishing in the oncological field,Open access publishing; Scientific publications; Oncology; Surveys; Italy,"Background: The paper intends to help scientific authors to make the best choice of journals in which to publish, by describing and comparing journal features in the area of oncology. For this purpose, the authors identified impact factor (IF) ranking, cost options and copyright conditions offered to authors wishing to publish in full open access (OA), subscription-based or hybrid journals. Methods: Data referring to articles published in 2010 by three Italian research institutions (National Institute of Health - Rome (ISS), Regina Elena National Cancer Institute - Rome (IRE), National Cancer Institute - Milan (INT) in journals (78) managed according to different business models, all listed in the Journal Citation Reports, subject category Oncology, were collected and analysed. The journals surveyed were ranked according to IF, position in quartiles, publication charges, usage rights in published articles, self-archiving conditions in OAI-compliant repositories digital archives. Results: Almost half (34) the journals surveyed were included in the first quartile, thus revealing authors' preference for journals with a high IF. The prevalent journal business model was the hybrid formula (based on subscriptions but also offering a paid OA option) with 51 journals, followed by subscription-based only journals accounting for 22, while just 5 full OA journals were identified. In general, no relationship was found between IF and article publication charges, in terms of correspondence between more expensive fees and higher IF. Conclusions: The issue of OA journals as compared with traditional subscription-based journals is highly debated among stakeholders: library administrators facing financial restrictions, authors seeking to locate the best outlet for their research, publishers wishing to increase their revenues by offering journals with wider appeal. Against this background, factors such as the quest for alternatives to high-cost business models, investments in setting up institutional repositories hosting the published versions of articles and efforts to overcome copyright barriers and gain free access to scientific literature are all crucial.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=med,t=publisher,geo=ITA,,,"Poltronieri, Elisabetta; Bravo, Elena; Camerini, Tiziana; Ferri, Maurizio; Rizzo, Roberto; Solimini, Renata; Cognetti, Gaetana",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH,English,Article,,,,,"[Poltronieri, Elisabetta] Ist Super Sanita, Publishing Unit, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Bravo, Elena] Ist Super Sanita, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Camerini, Tiziana] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Milan, Italy; [Ferri, Maurizio] Ist Super Sanita, Data Management Unit, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Rizzo, Roberto; Cognetti, Gaetana] Regina Elena Inst Canc Res, Sci & Patient Lib, Rome, Italy; [Solimini, Renata] Ist Super Sanita, Dept Therapeut Res & Med Evaluat, I-00161 Rome, Italy",,23,7,BMC,1756-9966,,2013,32,,,,10.1186/1756-9966-32-4,,,,23339627,2021-01-27
2060,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,"Science, institutional archives and open access: an overview and a pilot survey on the Italian cancer research institutions",,"Background: The Open Archive Initiative (OAI) refers to a movement started around the '90s to guarantee free access to scientific information by removing the barriers to research results, especially those related to the ever increasing journal subscription prices. This new paradigm has reshaped the scholarly communication system and is closely connected to the build up of institutional repositories (IRs) conceived to the benefit of scientists and research bodies as a means to keep possession of their own literary production. The IRs are high-value tools which permit authors to gain visibility by enabling rapid access to scientific material (not only publications) thus increasing impact (citation rate) and permitting a multidimensional assessment of research findings. Methods: A survey was conducted in March 2010 to mainly explore the managing system in use for archiving the research finding adopted by the Italian Scientific Institutes for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care (IRCCS) of the oncology area within the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN). They were asked to respond to a questionnaire intended to collect data about institutional archives, metadata formats and posting of full-text documents. The enquiry concerned also the perceived role of the institutional repository DSpace ISS, built up by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) and based on a XML scheme for encoding metadata. Such a repository aims at acting as a unique reference point for the biomedical information produced by the Italian research institutions. An in-depth analysis has also been performed on the collection of information material addressed to patients produced by the institutions surveyed. Results: The survey respondents were 6 out of 9. The results reveal the use of different practices and standard among the institutions concerning: the type of documentation collected, the software adopted, the use and format of metadata and the conditions of accessibility to the IRs. Conclusions: The Italian research institutions in the field of oncology are moving the first steps towards the philosophy of OA. The main effort should be the implementation of common procedures also in order to connect scientific publications to researchers curricula. In this framework, an important effort is represented by the project of ISS aimed to set a common interface able to allow migration of data from partner institutions to the OA compliant repository DSpace ISS.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=med,t=librarian,geo=ITA,,,"Poltronieri, Elisabetta; Truccolo, Ivana; Di Benedetto, Corrado; Castelli, Mauro; Mazzocut, Mauro; Cognetti, Gaetana",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH,English,Article,,,,,"[Cognetti, Gaetana] Ist Regina Elena Natl Canc Inst, Sci & Patient Lib, Rome, Italy; [Poltronieri, Elisabetta] Ist Super Sanita, Publishing Unit, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Truccolo, Ivana; Mazzocut, Mauro] IRCCS, Ctr Riferimento Oncol, Sci & Patient Lib, Aviano, Italy; [Di Benedetto, Corrado] Ist Super Sanita, Informat Technol Unit, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Castelli, Mauro] Ist Regina Elena Natl Canc Inst, JECCR, Rome, Italy",,21,2,BMC,1756-9966,,2010,29,,,,10.1186/1756-9966-29-168,,,,21172002,2021-01-27

Recently, a new wave of interest, debate, and practice surrounding OA publishing has emerged. In this paper, we provide a simple overview of the trends in OA practice in the broad field of geochemistry. Characteristics of the approach such as whether or not an article processing charge (APC) exists, what embargo periods or restrictions on self-archiving' policies are in place, and whether or not the sharing of preprints is permitted are described. The majority of journals have self-archiving policies that allow authors to share their peer reviewed work via green OA without charge. There is no clear relationship between journal impact and APC. The journals with the highest APC are typically those of the major commercial publishers, rather than the geochemistry community themselves. The rise in OA publishing has potential impacts on the profiles of researchers and tends to devolve costs from organizations to individuals. Until the geochemistry community makes the decision to move away from journal-based evaluation criteria, it is likely that such high costs will continue to impose financial inequities upon research community. However, geochemists could more widely choose legal self-archiving as an equitable and sustainable way to disseminate their research.",a=openaccess,m=biblio,d=natscie,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Pourret, Olivier; Hursthouse, Andrew; Irawan, Dasapta Erwin; Johannesson, Karen; Liu, Haiyan; Poujol, Marc; Tartese, Romain; van Hullebusch, Eric D.; Wiche, Oliver",,,,J,,HELIYON,English,Article,,,,,"[Pourret, Olivier] UniLaSalle, AGHYLE, Beauvais, France; [Hursthouse, Andrew] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland; [Irawan, Dasapta Erwin] Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Earth Sci & Technol, Bandung, Indonesia; [Johannesson, Karen] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Liu, Haiyan] East China Univ Technol, Sch Water Resources & Environm Engn, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Poujol, Marc] Univ Rennes, Geosci Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Tartese, Romain] Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [van Hullebusch, Eric D.] Univ Paris, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS, Paris, France; [Wiche, Oliver] TU Bergakad Freiberg, Biol Ecol Unit, Inst Biosci, Freiberg, Germany",,18,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,2405-8440,,2020,6,3,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03551,,,,32181407,2021-01-27

Yet subscription-based journals remain the most dominant in the social sciences and humanities, and it is often a struggle for newer open access publications to compete, in terms of economic, cultural, and symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 2004). Our study explores the meanings of resistance held by the editors of open access journals in the social sciences and humanities in Canada, as well as the views of university librarians. To make sense of these meanings, we draw on Lonnie Athens' (2015) radical interactionist account of power, and expand on this by incorporating George Herbert Mead's (1932, 1938) theory of emergence, arguing that open access is characteristic of an extended rationality (Chang, 2004) for those involved. Drawing on our open-ended interview data, we find that open access is experienced as a form of resistance in at least four ways. These include resistance to (1) profit motives in academic publishing; (2) access barriers for audiences; (3) access barriers for contributors; and (4) traditional publishing conventions.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=socscie; d=hum,t=librarian; t=publisher,geo=CAN,,,"Price, Taylor; Puddephatt, Antony",,,,S,"Musolf, GR","OPPRESSION AND RESISTANCE: STRUCTURE, AGENCY, TRANSFORMATION",English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,"[Price, Taylor] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Puddephatt, Antony] Lakehead Univ, Sociol, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada",,47,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,0163-2396,978-1-78743-167-6,2017,48,,95,115,10.1108/S0163-239620180000048008,,,,,2021-01-27

However, data friction, as the phenomenon of data underutilisation for several causes, has also been pointed out. A factor often called into question for ORD low usage is the quality of the ORD and associated metadata. This work aims to illustrate the use of ORD, published by the Figshare scientific repository, concerning their scientific discipline, their type and compared with the quality of their metadata. Considering all the Figshare resources and carrying out a programmatic quality assessment of their metadata, our analysis highlighted two aspects. First, irrespective of the scientific domain considered, most ORD are under-used, but with exceptional cases which concentrate most researchers' attention. Second, there was no evidence that the use of ORD is associated with good metadata publishing practices.

The Case of Open Data Practices in Educational Technology Research,Open Data; Open Science; Open Data repositories; social media; ResearchGate; Educational Technology research,"In the landscape of Open Science, Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role as data are one of the most basic components of research, despite their diverse formats across scientific disciplines. Opening up data is a recent concern for policy makers and researchers, as the basis for good Open Science practices. The common factor underlying these new practices-the relevance of promoting Open Data circulation and reuse-is mostly a social form of knowledge sharing and construction. However, while data sharing is being strongly promoted by policy making and is becoming a frequent practice in some disciplinary fields, Open Data sharing is much less developed in Social Sciences and in educational research. In this study, practices of OD publication and sharing in the field of Educational Technology are explored. The aim is to investigate Open Data sharing in a selection of Open Data repositories, as well as in the academic social network site ResearchGate. The 23 Open Datasets selected across five OD platforms were analysed in terms of (a) the metrics offered by the platforms and the affordances for social activity; (b) the type of OD published; (c) the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) data principles compliance; and (d) the extent of presence and related social activity on ResearchGate.

This contribution introduces a multi-method corpus analysis tool, specifically conceived for scientific corpuses with spatialised content. We propose a dedicated interactive application that integrates three strategies for building semantic networks, using keywords (self-declared themes), citations (areas of research using the papers) and full-texts (themes derived from the words used in writing). The networks can be studied with respect to their temporal evolution as well as to their spatial expressions, by considering the countries studied in the papers under inquiry. The tool is applied as a proof-of-concept on the papers published in the online open access geography journal Cybergeo since its creation in 1996. Finally, we compare the three methods and conclude that their complementarity can help go beyond simple statistics to better understand the epistemological evolution of a scientific community and the readership target of the journal.

It is argued that the University of Cape Town (UCT), a leading research university on the African continent with relatively high research output, has a social justice obligation to distribute freely its scholarly research to the widest audience possible. Contributing to this social justice obligation through the sharing of research output via open access (OA) platforms are the university's progressive OA policy and activities to ensure roll-out of the policy as well as its commitments to support article processing charges (APCs) and follow the global trend with regard to OA publishing. The authors, using a case study design, report that these factors have contributed to UCT's researchers adapting to publishing their journal articles on OA platforms.

However, their merits in representing or providing added values to scientific articles have not yet been studied. Therefore, the present study investigates the informativeness of open review reports as a kind of social comments in a scholarly setting. Design/methodology/approach A test collection was built consisting of 100 randomly selected queries, 1,962 reviewed documents and their reviewers' open reports from F1000Research. They were analyzed using natural language techniques. The comments' salient words were compared to the documents' and also to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) salient words. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to test the accuracy of the comments in representing their related articles. Findings The papers' contents and comments have a considerable number of salient words in common. The comments' salient words are also largely found in the MeSH, signifying their consistency with the knowledge tree and their potential to add some complementary features to their related items. The ROC curves confirm the accuracy of the comments in retrieving their related papers.

2137,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Observations and Perceptions of Academic Administrator Influence on Open Access Initiatives,Academic administrators; Open access; Scholarly communication,"Existing literature frequently covers the topic of open access from the perspectives of authors, librarians, or publishers. Investigations into the role of academic administrators, however, remain limited. Because librarians are uniquely positioned in the center of the scholarly communication ecosystem a survey of library directors was conducted to investigate the nature of any relationship between the actions of academic administrators and an institution's commitment to open access, as observed by librarians. Results indicate that, according to the perspective of librarians, as academic administrator attention to open access increases, open access activities of faculty and librarians also increase. Open access advocates should reflect upon the role of academic administrators and consider increasing efforts to gain the support of these individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a case study of China and empirical data collected through semi-structured interviews with a wide range of academics and stakeholders. Findings - A separation between the communication and certification functions of publishing is identified: open initiatives are valued for efficient and interactive communication while traditional publishing still dominates the legitimacy of research publications, which leads to the quandary of individual academics operating within the transitional landscape of scholarly communication. Practical implications - Practical recommendations for sustainable and efficient openness are derived from discussions on the difficulties associated open/social certification and the shifting maxims that govern academics from publish or perish to be visible or vanish. Originality/value - Openness is defined in broad sense integrating Open Access and open scholarship to comprehensively reflect individual academics' views in the transitional landscape of academic publishing.

Therefore, we aimed to explore the awareness of predatory journals among oncologists. Methods An online survey among oncologists working in Germany or Austria of various professional surroundings was conducted between October 2018 and April 2019. Results One hundred and eighty-eight participants (55 women (29.2%), 128 men (68.1%)) completed the questionnaire. 41 (21.8%) participants indicated to work in a hospital, 24 (12.8%) in private practice and 112 (59.6%) in a university hospital. 98.9% of participants indicated to actively read scientific articles and consider them in clinical decision-making (96.3%). 90.4% of participants indicated to have scientific experience by publishing papers in journals with peer-review system. The open-access system was known by 170 (90.4%), predatory journals by 131 (69.7%) and Beall's list by 52 participants (27.7%). Predatory journals were more likely to be known by participants with a higher number of publications (p<0.001), with more high-impact publications (p=0.005) and with recent publications (p<0.001). Awareness of predatory journals did not correlate with gender (p=0.515) or translation of scientific literature into clinical practice (p=0.543). Conclusions The problematic topic of 'predatory journals' is still unknown by a considerable amount of oncologist, although the survey was taken in a cohort of oncologists with scientific experience.

2155,SCOPUS,juergen_schneider,Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? An empirical study in the field of intensive care medicine,Open access; Citation analysis; Intensive car; Medicine; Hirsch index,"Objective: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of citations count. Methods: We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. Potentially confounding variables for citatiorj,counts were adjusted for in a linear multiple regression model. Results: The median number (interquartile range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in the case of open access articles (p = 0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), the citation count was beta (10-16) and 18 (eta-21) (p = 0.008), respectively. The mean follow-up was 37.5 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after publication, the average number (mean standard deviation) of citations per article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 0.6 versus 0.38 0.7 in the case of open access articles (p = 0.043). Independent factors for citation advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (beta=0.207; p = 0.015) and open access status (beta=3.618; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication. (C) 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC.

Infrastructures of data are highly rhetorical, because they structure how others interact with information and reflect hierarchies of information, people, and things. Those creating open source and open science projects, in particular, must consider how they structure their data according to principles of accessibility, reusability, and replicability. Failure to consider the design of publicly available code and insufficient user documentation lead to issues with transparency, learnability, and usability within open source science projects. This paper explores the decision-making processes of two open science researchers as they design their data according to the principles of open science. Using interviews and document analysis, I analyze the rhetorical coding choices of researchers and how these choices encourage or discourage accessibility for different audiences. Ultimately, I examine what accessibility means for these researchers working under the umbrella of open science. © 2020 ACM.",a=opendata,m=interview; m=document review,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=USA,,,Roberts L.,,,,,,SIGDOC 2020 - Proceedings of the 38th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication,English,Conference Paper,"38th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication, SIGDOC 2020",5 October 2020 through 9 October 2020,0,,,,,0,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",0,9781450375252,2020,0,0,0,0,10.1145/3380851.3416786,,,,,2021-01-27

The younger age brackets reported higher percentages of publishing history than older age brackets, but these younger groups tended to also be tenured. Credibility of OA journals was the top concern of respondents.

Flipping a society journal from a subscription model to fully open access may drive down satisfaction. Professional society members state a desire for increased collaboration with academics and feel that societies have a role to play in this. Satisfaction levels with society membership are generally low amongst early career members (ECMs), but there are some clear opportunities for targeted services to improve this.

Yet to date no large-scale survey of attitudes towards OPR amongst academic editors, authors, reviewers and publishers has been undertaken. This paper presents the findings of an online survey, conducted for the OpenAIRE2020 project during September and October 2016, that sought to bridge this information gap in order to aid the development of appropriate OPR approaches by providing evidence about attitudes towards and levels of experience with OPR. The results of this cross-disciplinary survey, which received 3,062 full responses, show the majority (60.3%) of respondents to be believe that OPR as a general concept should be mainstream scholarly practice (although attitudes to individual traits varied, and open identities peer review was not generally favoured). Respondents were also in favour of other areas of Open Science, like Open Access (88.2%) and Open Data (80.3%). Among respondents we observed high levels of experience with OPR, with three out of four (76.2%) reporting having taken part in an OPR process as author, reviewer or editor. There were also high levels of support for most of the traits of OPR, particularly open interaction, open reports and final-version commenting. Respondents were against opening reviewer identities to authors, however, with more than half believing it would make peer review worse. Overall satisfaction with the peer review system used by scholarly journals seems to strongly vary across disciplines. Taken together, these findings are very encouraging for OPR's prospects for moving mainstream but indicate that due care must be taken to avoid a one-size fits all solution and to tailor such systems to differing (especially disciplinary) contexts.

2198,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Are Funder Open Access Platforms a Good Idea?,open access; scholarly communications; research funders; publishing platforms,"As open access (OA) to publications continues to gather momentum, we should continuously question whether it is moving in the right direction. A novel intervention in this space is the creation of OA publishing platforms commissioned by funding organizations. Examples include those of the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation, as well as recently announced initiatives from public funders like the European Commission and the Irish Health Research Board. As the number of such platforms increases, it becomes urgently necessary to assess in which ways, for better or worse, this emergent phenomenon complements or disrupts the scholarly communications landscape. This article examines ethical, organizational, and economic strengths and weaknesses of such platforms, as well as usage and uptake to date, to scope the opportunities and threats presented by funder OA platforms in the ongoing transition to OA. The article is broadly supportive of the aims and current implementations of such platforms, finding them a novel intervention which stands to help increase OA uptake, control costs of OA, lower administrative burden on researchers, and demonstrate funders' commitment to fostering open practices. However, the article identifies key areas of concern about the potential for unintended consequences, including the appearance of conflicts of interest, difficulties of scale, potential lock-in, and issues of the branding of research.

A sample of 3,730 journal articles published by authors from CERCA research centres between 2011 and 2015 and available on Web of Science (out of a total output of 44,423) was analysed to identify how many were available in open access, full-text format. The results revealed that 75,8% of the total (2,828 articles) had at least one version available in open access, but just 52% (1,940 articles) had at least one version available in either journals (whether pure or hybrid open access journals or those with embargo periods) or repositories, a finding that highlights the powerful role played by academic social networks in the sharp increase in open access availability. Of the 2,828 articles for which at least one open access version was found, a total of 9,868 copies were located. With respect to versions, the publisher's final version, i.e. the type formatted for publication by journal publishers, was found in 75,3% of cases. The number of articles published in open access journals (567) was very close to the number of articles published in hybrid journals or journals with embargo periods (624). Only 40,4% of the articles in the sample were located in repositories, being the subject repositories the heaviest used. Fifty percent of the articles (1,881 publications) were posted on academic social networks, the most popular of which were ResearchGate and Academia. According to thematic areas, all six areas (science, life sciences, medical and health sciences, engineering and architecture and humanities) exceeded 70% of articles in open access.

This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics. Issues covered include: use of and intentions regarding OAP, and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP, journal article publication services, peer review, and reuse. Despite reporting engagement in OAP, academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP. Broadly, academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP, and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages. As regards services, rigorous peer review, followed by rapid publication were most valued. Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse, but not in favor of commercial reuse, adaptations, and inclusion in anthologies. Comparing science, technology, and medicine with arts, humanities, and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions, but, in general, the effect size was small, suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,y=2014,,"Rowley, Jennifer; Johnson, Frances; Sbaffi, Laura; Frass, Will; Devine, Elaine",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Rowley, Jennifer; Johnson, Frances; Sbaffi, Laura] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Languages Informat & Commun, Geoffrey Manton Bldg, Manchester M15 6LL, Lancs, England; [Frass, Will; Devine, Elaine] Taylor & Francis Grp, 4 Pk Sq, Abingdon OX14 4RN, Oxon, England",,41,25,WILEY,2330-1635,,2017,68,5,1201,1211,10.1002/asi.23710,,,,,2021-01-27

The library has overseen the open science services that have been actively implemented from 2010 onwards due to the development of the digitalisation of science and open science policies. A survey was conducted to determine how the UEF’s academic faculty use the services provided as well as their attitudes towards opening their own research findings in this manner. The researchers seem to be most interested in issues that influence their daily work, i.e. data management plans and opening their publications. It seems that the culture of openness is still at the development stage within UEF. The innovators, i.e. active research groups and researchers, are already practicing and encouraging openness, but the majority of the academic staff seems to be either unaware of open science or unwilling to implement it, due to the fact that incentives and career advancements still support the traditional way of conducting research. © 2020, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Design/methodology/approach - After acquiring all the papers published by these journals during 2002-2007, their web citations were extracted and analyzed from an accessibility point of view. Moreover, for initially missed citations complementary pathways such as using Internet Explorer and the Google search engine were employed. Findings - The study revealed that at first check 73 per cent of URLs are accessible, while 27 per cent have disappeared. It is notable that the rate of accessibility increased to 89 per cent and the rate of decay decreased to 11 per cent after using complementary pathways. The .net domain, with an availability of 96 per cent (a decay of 4 per cent) has the greatest stability and persistence among all domains, while the most stable file format is PDF, with an availability of 93 per cent (a decay of 7 per cent).

2230,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Open access publishing: a study of current practices in orthopaedic research,Open access journals; Scientific research,"Background Open access (OA) publications have changed the paradigm of dissemination of scientific research. Their benefits to low-income countries underline their value; however, critics question exorbitant publication fees as well as their effect on the peer review process and research quality. purpose This study reports on the prevalence of OA publishing in orthopaedic research and compares benchmark citation indices as well as evidence quality derived from OA journals with conventional subscription based orthopaedic journals. Methods All 63 orthopaedic journals listed in ISI's Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Report (JCR) were examined. Bibliometric data attributed to each journal for the year 2012 was acquired from the JCR. Studies that fulfilled the criteria of level I evidence were identified for each journal within PubMed. Individual journal websites were reviewed to identify their open access policy. A total of 38 (60.3 %) journals did not offer any form of OA publishing; however, 20 (31.7 %) hybrid journals were identified which offered authors the choice to publish their work as OA if a publication fee was paid. Only five (8 %) journals published all their articles as OA. There was variability amongst the different publication fees for OA articles. Journals that published OA articles did not differ from subscription based journals on the basis of 2012 impact factor, citation number, self citation proportion or the volume of level I evidence published (p > 0.05). Conclusions OA journals are present in orthopaedic research, though in small numbers. Over a third of orthopaedic journals catalogued in the ISI Web of Knowledge JCRA (R) are hybrid journals that provide authors with the opportunity to publish their articles as OA after a publication fee is paid. This study suggests equivalent importance and quality of articles between OA and subscription based orthopaedic journals based on bibliometric data and the volume of level I evidence produced. Orthopaedic researchers must recognize the potential benefits of OA publishing and its emerging presence within the field. Further examination and consensus is required in orthopaedic research to generate an OA system that is robustly regulated and maintains research quality.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=med,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,y=2012,,"Sabharwal, Sanjeeve; Patel, Nirav; Johal, Karanjeev",,,,J,,INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Sabharwal, Sanjeeve] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, St Marys Hosp, Dept Surg & Canc, London W2 1NY, England; [Patel, Nirav] Hillingdon Hosp, Trauma & Orthopaed Surg, London, England; [Johal, Karanjeev] North West London NHS Trust, London, England",,23,11,SPRINGER,0341-2695,,2014,38,6,1297,1302,10.1007/s00264-013-2250-5,,,,24384939,2021-01-27

Quantitative and qualitative analysis was carried out on data obtained from 516 journals and questionnaires applied to 400 publishers and 101 authors. Although most of the journals are free and considered as open access by their publishers, actually, in many cases they have established restrictive copyright policies or lack explicit information on terms and conditions of use and publishing of their articles.

Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2007 through a printed questionnaire administered to a group of Cuban researchers from several national health institutes, who were selected by means of a stratified random sampling (160 researchers from 11 institutions). Summary statistics and bivariate correlations were obtained using the spss statistical program, version 10.0 for Windows. Results: The best known initiatives for researchers were those related to biomedical sciences, i.e. PubMed Central, HINARI and BioMed Central. The rate of publication in open access journals and deposit in open access repositories was low. Most of researchers (85%) agree to upload a copy of their papers onto an open access repository if their institution requests so.

2253,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,An Open Access Policy for the Scientific Output of Cuba's National Health System,,"The open access movement seeks to recover the original principles behind scholarly communication - disseminating the results of research as broadly as possible, so that they can be analyzed, discussed, evaluated and confirmed by the scientific community, while eliminating legal, economic or technological barriers for the access to such documents. Open access policies can be considered catalysts of favourable attitudes and behaviours in this sense. In the particular case of Cuba, widespread and equal access to knowledge and information has been a core issue of social development policies since 1959. Nonetheless, there are weaknesses in the register of scientific production, and the accessibility and visibility of some types of documents in the health sector. This paper presents an outline for developing an open access policy to disseminate the scientific output of Cuba's National Health System. The four-stage analytical process involved questionnaires, interviews, focal groups, content analysis, and a Delphi policy study. The findings underline the benefits of obligatory register and deposit of Cuban scientific articles, Master's and PhD theses, and books on medicine and the health sciences, and thus, that their availability through open access be achieved as soon as possible.",a=openaccess,m=interview;  m=document review,d=med,t=policy,geo=CUB,,,"Sanchez-Tarrago, Nancy;  Carlos Fernandez-Molina, J.;  Caballero Rivero, Alejandro",,,,J,,LIBRI,English,Article,,,,,"[Sanchez-Tarrago, Nancy] Minist Salud Publ Cuba, Direcc Nacl Epidemiol, Havana, Cuba;  [Carlos Fernandez-Molina, J.] Univ Granada, Dept Informac & Comunicac, Granada, Spain;  [Caballero Rivero, Alejandro] Acad Ciencias Cuba, Havana, Cuba",,31,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,0024-2667,,2012,62,3,211,221,10.1515/libri-2012-0017,,,,,2021-01-27

Therefore, many researchers and institutions are searching for alternative models for disseminating scholarly work that bypasses the current structure of paywalls. This study aimed to determine whether a self-published open access (OA) journal, the International Journal of Health Sciences (UHS), has been able to reach a global audience in terms of authorship, readership, and impact using the OA model. Methods: All IJHS articles were retrieved and analyzed using scientometric methods. Using the keywords from abstracts and titles, unsupervised clustering was performed to map research trends. Network analysis was used to chart the network of collaboration. The analysis of articles' metadata and the visualizations was performed using R programming language. Results: Using Google Scholar as a source, the general statistics of IJHS from inception to 2019 showed that the average citation per article was 11.29, and the impact factor of the journal was 2.28. The results demonstrate the obvious local and global impact of a locally published journal that allows unrestricted OA and uses an open source publishing platform. The journal's success at attracting diverse topics, authors, and readers is a testament to the power of the OA model. Conclusions: Open source is feasible and rewarding and enables a global reach for research from under-represented regions.

Secondly, to examine influencing factors that enhance the level of openness in researching, in particular, “transparency”, “reputation”, “participation”, “funding”, “foundation” and “size”. The main results show that those private and older universities, best-ranked in terms of excellence researching and those that have been gradually adopting Open Government policies concerning the dissemination of information through institutional web pages and social participation, are the most interested with complying the recommendations established by the authorities of the Open Science projects.

The survey of 1,329 researchers was conducted by the Usability and Assessment Working Group of DataONE from October 2009 to July 2010. The analysis of the data is threefold, namely: visualization of a 2-mode network, descriptive statistics, and ordered logistic regression. The visualization of the affiliated network shows a disconnected access pattern. With the majority of researchers accessing one database and only a few connecting or accessing more than one database. The results of the survey using descriptive and inferential statistics pointed at two key determinants of publishing research datasets online, namely: data management and attribution to the datasets owner.

This transfer is being controlled, more and more, by the use of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). Therefore, the effect of MTAs on the dynamic of knowledge creation is an important concern. The aim of this research is to characterise the restrictions imposed by MTAs, and their determinants. We consider MTA diversity based on a comprehensive analysis of the clauses included in 171 MTAs signed by two French universities. We show that the clauses included in MTAs depend on several factors such as kind of material involved, research field, patenting and collection of material. We find that the presence of an industry actor is not associated to more restrictions on publication and intellectual property. We propose a typology of MTAs corresponding to different transfer situations.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a comparative survey of five major scientific and technical information centres: The British Library (UK), KM (Canada), INIST- CNRS (France), KISTI (South Korea) and TIB Hannover (Germany). Findings - The five institutions supplied less than 1.8 million supplied items in 2014, i. e. half of the activity in 2004 (- 55 per cent). There were 85,000 grey documents, mainly conference proceedings and reports, i. e. 5 per cent of the overall activity, a historically low level compared to 2004 (- 72 per cent). At the same time, they continue to expand their open access strategies. Just as in 2004 and 2008, these strategies are specific, and they reflect institutional and national choices rather than global approaches, with two or three common or comparable projects (PubMed Central, national repositories, attribution of DOIs to datasets, dissertations and other objects). In spite of all differences, their development reveals some common features, like budget cuts, legal barriers (copyright), focus on domestic needs and open access policies to foster dissemination and impact of research results. Document supply for corporate customers tends to become a business-to-business service, while the delivery for the public sector relies more, than before, on resource sharing and networking with academic and public libraries. Except perhaps for the TIB Hannover, the declining importance of grey literature points towards their changing role - less intermediation, less acquisition and collection development and more high-value services, more dissemination and preservation capacities designed for the scientific community needs (research excellence, open access, data management, etc.).

Design/methodology/approach - A review of recent papers, published after the Berlin Declaration on Open Access in 2003. Findings - Everything seems to oppose document supply and open access. Open access has contributed to the recent decline of interlibrary loan (ILL) and document supply requests but is not the only reason and probably not the most important. Open repositories and open-access journals have the potential to substitute ILL and document supply;  yet for different reasons, including legal compliance, this substitution remains of limited interest. ILL and document supply institutions have started to integrate open access into their workflow and service provision in different ways, and the paper provides a conceptual framework with some perspectives for further service development.

Methodology/approach - The case study presents the results of a lecture on information rights and ethics with 50 Master students in library and information sciences (LIS) at the University of Lille (France) in 2014-2015. Students were asked to comment on the core principles of the International Federation of Library Association (IFLA) Code of Ethics. Findings - The students see the library as a privileged space of access to information, where the librarian takes on the function of a guardian of this specific individual freedom - a highly political role and task. This opinion is part of a general commitment to open access and free flowing resources on Internet. They emphasize the social responsibility toward the society as a whole but most of all toward the individual patron as a real person, member of a cultural community, a social class or an ethnic group. With regard to Human Rights, the students interpret the IFLA Code mainly as a code of civil, political, and critical responsibility to endorse the universal right of freedom of expression. They see a major conflict between ethics and policy. The findings are followed by some recommendations for further development of LIS education, including internship, transversality, focus on conflicts and the students' cognitive dissonance and teaching of social skills, in terms of work-based solidarity and collective choices.

A survey on open access with scientists from the French National Research Center (CNRS),Open access; Open repositories; OA publishing; Open science; Research management; Self-archiving,"Purpose - This paper aims to present empirical evidence on the opinion and behaviour of French scientists (senior management level) regarding open access (OA) to scientific and technical information. Design/methodology/approach - The results are part of a nationwide survey on scientific information and documentation with 432 directors of French public research laboratories conducted by the French National Research Center (CNRS) in 2014. Findings - The CNRS senior research managers (laboratory directors) globally share the positive opinion towards OA revealed by other studies with researchers from the UK, Germany, the USA and other countries. However, they are more supportive of open repositories (green road) than of OA journal publishing (gold). The response patterns reveal a gap between generally positive opinions about OA and less supportive behaviours, principally publishing articles with article processing charges (APCs). A small group of senior research managers does not seem to be interested in green or gold OA and reluctant to self-archiving and OA publishing. Similar to other studies, the French survey confirms disciplinary differences, i.e. a stronger support for self-archiving of records and documents in HAL by scientists from Mathematics, Physics and Informatics than from Biology, Earth Sciences and Chemistry; and more experience and positive feelings with OA publishing and payment of APCs in Biology than in Mathematics or in Social Sciences and Humanities. Disciplinary differences and specific French factors are discussed, in particular in the context of the new European policy in favour of Open Science. Originality/value - For the first time, a nationwide survey was conducted with the senior research management level from all scientific disciplines.

Design: An electronic survey. Setting: Authors of research papers submitted to BMJ, Archives of Disease in Childhood, and Journal of Medical Genetics in 2004. Main outcome measures: Familiarity with and perceptions of open access and author-pays publishing. Results: 468/1113 (42%) responded. Prior to definitions being provided, 47% (222/468) and 38% (176/468) reported they were familiar with the terms 'open access' and 'author-pays' publishing, respectively. Some who did not at first recognize the terms, did claim to recognize them when they were defined. Only 10% (49/468) had submitted to an author-pays journal. Compared with non-open access subscription-based journals, 35% agreed that open access author-pays journals have a greater capacity to publish more content making it easier to get published, 27% thought they had lower impact factors, 31% thought they had taster and more timely publicaitons, and 46% agreed that people will think anyone can pay to get published. 55% (256/468) thought they would not continue to submit to their respective journal if it became open access and charged, largely because of the reputaiton of the journals. Half (54%, 255/468) said open access has 'no impact' or was 'low priority' in their submission decisions. Two-thirds (66%, 308/468) said they would prefer to submit to a non-open access subscription-based journal than an open access author-pays journal. Over half thought they would have to make a contribution or pay the full cost of an author charge (56%, 262/468).

Providing higher dissemination and therefore visibility as well as better accessibility, among others, Open Access helps to fulfil changed needs of authors and readers in our information and communication society of today. Though this publication model provides a lot of advantages both for readers and authors, there are also some obstacles. In order to identify the incentives that can lead scientists of medical informatics to an Open-Access-publication, we conducted a study consisting of group discussions, interviews, and surveys. This tripartite evaluation starts in its first part with group discussions and interviews. First results of them show that, among others, the higher visibility, indexing, Impact Factor and better accessibility are factors for an Open-Access-publication. © 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

Open access (OA) journal publishing can play a major role in providing research results and scholarly material to the public freely. This paper examines the perceptions and attitudes of Arab researchers and scholars toward publishing their research in open-access journals. The paper also explores the factors that may encourage or discourage the publication of Arabic scholarly content in the open-access journals. The study is based on survey questionnaire administered to a sample of Arab academics in the fields of computing and information technology. Results revealed poor contributions of Arab researchers and scholars in enriching the Arabic web content via OA publishing initiatives. These findings may help to alert people concerned with the Arabic content to encourage and foster such participation in the future. © 2012 IEEE.,a=openaccess,m=survey,d=natscie,t=researcher; t=university,geo=SA,geo not specified; focus on language,,"Seliaman M.E., Salim E., Eldow M.E.Y.",,,,,,"CHUSER 2012 - 2012 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research",English,Conference Paper,"2012 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research, CHUSER 2012",3 December 2012 through 4 December 2012,"Kota Kinabalu, Sabah",,,,,0,0,0,9781467346153,2012,0,0,168,171,10.1109/CHUSER.2012.6504304,,,,,2021-01-27
2330,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Usage Trends of Open Access and Local Journals: A Korean Case Study,,"Articles from open access and local journals are important resources for research in Korea and the usage trends of these articles are important indicators for the assessment of the current research practice. We analyzed an institutional collection of published papers from 1998 to 2014 authored by researchers from Seoul National University, and their references from papers published between 1998 and 2011. The published papers were collected from Web of Science or Scopus and were analyzed according to the proportion of articles from open access journals. Their cited references from published papers in Web of Science were analyzed according to the proportion of local (South Korean) or open access journals. The proportion of open access papers was relatively stable until 2006 (2.5 similar to 5.2% in Web of Science and 2.7 similar to 4.2% in Scopus), but then increased to 15.9%(Web of Science) or 18.5% (Scopus) in 2014. We analyzed 2,750,485 cited references from 52,295 published papers. We found that the overall proportion of cited articles from local journals was 1.8% and that for open access journals was 3.0%. Citations of open access articles have increased since 2006 to 4.1% in 2011, although the increase in open access article citations was less than for open access publications. The proportion of citations from local journals was even lower. We think that the publishing / citing mismatch is a term to describe this difference, which is an issue at Seoul National University, where the number of published papers at open access or local journals is increasing but the number of citations is not. The cause of this discrepancy is multi-factorial but the governmental / institutional policies, social / cultural issues and authors' citing behaviors will explain the mismatch. However, additional measures are also necessary, such as the development of an institutional citation database and improved search capabilities with respect to local and open access documents.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=librarian;  t=researcher;  t=university,geo=KOR,,,"Seo, Jeong-Wook;  Chung, Hosik;  Yun, Jungmin;  Park, Jin Young;  Park, Eunsun;  Ahn, Yuri",,,,J,,PLOS ONE,English,Article,,,,,"[Seo, Jeong-Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Seoul 151, South Korea;  [Chung, Hosik] Naver Corp, Contents Platform Lab, Songnam, Kyunggi Do, South Korea;  [Yun, Jungmin] Korea Inst Ind Technol, Korea Natl Ind Convergence Ctr, Ansan, Kyunggi Do, South Korea;  [Park, Jin Young;  Park, Eunsun;  Ahn, Yuri] Seoul Natl Univ, Med Lib, Seoul, South Korea",,40,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,1932-6203,,2016,11,5,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0155843,,,,27195948,2021-01-27
2333,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Open Access Awareness and Perceptions in an Institutional Landscape,Institutional repository; Open access journals; Open access; Services on top of repositories; Open access institutional policy,"The aim of this study was to determine the awareness of open access among the academic staff of a research oriented Spanish university, their use of the institutional repository and their satisfaction with its services. An anonymous survey of 37 questions was sent to all professors, researchers and doctoral students of the University of Navarra. A total of 352 responses (17%) were received. The responses showed statistically significant differences in opinions concerning open access journals and services created on top of the repository. Although there was general agreement on the need for open access, half the respondents adopted open access practices (which included the use of the institutional repository, and other pages and academic platforms). This percentage increased with the older respondents, who were also senior members of staff with tenure and positions of authority at the university. The decision to make publications accessible in open access depends on academic reward and on professional recognition. The services offered by the repository were generally perceived positively, with differences according to the age and subject area of the respondents. The awareness of those differences might help the university library to provide faculty with training and products that suit to their needs and habits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

2335,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Discipline-specific open access publishing practices and barriers to change: An evidence-based review,Communication Technologies; Meta-Synthesis; Open Access; Open Science; Publishing; Scholarly Communication; Science Policy; Scientometrics,"Background: Many of the discussions surrounding Open Access (OA) revolve around how it affects publishing practices across different academic disciplines. It was a long-held view that it would be only a matter of time before all disciplines fully and relatively homogeneously implemented OA. Recent large-scale bibliometric studies show, however, that the uptake of OA differs substantially across disciplines. We aimed to answer two questions: First, how do different disciplines adopt and shape OA publishing practices? Second, what discipline-specific barriers to and potentials for OA can be identified? Methods: In a first step, we identified and synthesized relevant bibliometric studies that assessed OA prevalence and publishing patterns across disciplines. In a second step, and adopting a social shaping of technology perspective, we studied evidence on the socio-technical forces that shape OA publishing practices. We examined a variety of data sources, including, but not limited to, publisher policies and guidelines, OA mandates and policies and author surveys. Results: Over the last three decades, scholarly publishing has experienced a shift from; access to OA as the proportion of scholarly literature that is openly accessible has increased continuously. Estimated OA levels for publication years after 2010 varied between 29.4% and 66%. The shift towards OA is uneven across disciplines in two respects: first, the growth of OA has been uneven across disciplines, which manifests itself in varying OA prevalence levels. Second, disciplines use different OA publishing channels to make research outputs OA. Conclusions: We conclude that historically rooted publishing practices differ in terms of their compatibility with OA, which is the reason why OA can be assumed to be a natural continuation of publishing cultures in some disciplines, whereas in other disciplines, the implementation of OA faces major barriers and would require a change of research culture. © 2020 Severin A et al.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=university; t=policy; t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Severin A., Egger M., Eve M.P., Hürlimann D.",,,,,,F1000Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,0,F1000 Research Ltd,20461402,0,2020,7,0,0,0,10.12688/f1000research.17328.2,,,,,2021-01-27

This article addresses this gap via a case study focusing on Chinese-language OA journals. It starts with the identification of the major characteristics of this market, followed by eight semi-structured interviews to explore the key motivations behind Chinese-language OA publishing and perceived barriers. The majority of Chinese OA journals are published in Chinese, and most of them are published by universities and scholarly societies. Nearly 80% of journals were launched before the digital age and were converted to OA later. The subject distribution is highly skewed towards the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) fields. Publishers are motivated to convert journals to OA by an expected increase in academic impact, which would also attract more submissions. The lack of a sufficient number of high-quality submissions is perceived as the largest barrier to the successful publishing of journals. The financial instability of journals is identified as the main obstacle hindering internationalisation. The central conclusions of the study are that Chinese-language OA journals need to increase their visibility in journal indexes such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and that an OA publishing platform (similar to the Latin American SciELO) should be established for Chinese-language OA journals.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=publisher;  t=researcher,geo=CHN,focus on language,,"Shen, Cenyu",,,,J,,PUBLICATIONS,English,Article,,,,,"[Shen, Cenyu] Hanken Sch Econ, Informat Syst Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland",,55,5,MDPI,2304-6775,,2017,5,4,,,10.3390/publications5040022,,,,,2021-01-27
2353,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,'Predatory' open access: a longitudinal study of article volumes and market characteristics,Open access;  Scientific publishing,"Background: A negative consequence of the rapid growth of scholarly open access publishing funded by article processing charges is the emergence of publishers and journals with highly questionable marketing and peer review practices. These so-called predatory publishers are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. Reports about this branch of e-business have so far mainly concentrated on exposing lacking peer review and scandals involving publishers and journals. There is a lack of comprehensive studies about several aspects of this phenomenon, including extent and regional distribution. Methods: After an initial scan of all predatory publishers and journals included in the so-called Beall's list, a sample of 613 journals was constructed using a stratified sampling method from the total of over 11,000 journals identified. Information about the subject field, country of publisher, article processing charge and article volumes published between 2010 and 2014 were manually collected from the journal websites. For a subset of journals, individual articles were sampled in order to study the country affiliation of authors and the publication delays. Results: Over the studied period, predatory journals have rapidly increased their publication volumes from 53,000 in 2010 to an estimated 420,000 articles in 2014, published by around 8,000 active journals. Early on, publishers with more than 100 journals dominated the market, but since 2012 publishers in the 10-99 journal size category have captured the largest market share. The regional distribution of both the publisher's country and authorship is highly skewed, in particular Asia and Africa contributed three quarters of authors. Authors paid an average article processing charge of 178 USD per article for articles typically published within 2 to 3 months of submission. Conclusions: Despite a total number of journals and publishing volumes comparable to respectable (indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals) open access journals, the problem of predatory open access seems highly contained to just a few countries, where the academic evaluation practices strongly favor international publication, but without further quality checks.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Shen, Cenyu;  Bjork, Bo-Christer",,,,J,,BMC MEDICINE,English,Article,,,,,"[Shen, Cenyu;  Bjork, Bo-Christer] Hanken Sch Econ, Informat Syst Sci, POB 479Arkadiankatu 22, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,34,288,BMC,1741-7015,,2015,13,,,,10.1186/s12916-015-0469-2,,,,26423063,2021-01-27

Email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to the selected journals on August 9, 2012. After two email reminders, the web survey closed on August 27. Six phone follow-ups were made to a random sample of 100 out of the 246 non-responders between September 7 and 14 to increase the response rate. Main Results - The final response rate for the survey was 24.8% (72 out of 290), and the findings had an 11.5% margin of error with 95% confidence interval. Only 12.5% of the journals surveyed indicated they would never accept manuscripts derived from open access ETDs, while 51.4% indicated revised EDTs are always welcome. The rest of the respondents had some acceptance restrictions, including case-by-case review (19.4%), accept only if the content differs significantly from the original (8.3%), accept or only if access to the original ETD was limited (1.4%). Five of the 72 respondents (6.9%) did not have a policy for accepting ETDs. Of the 17 researcher-created discipline categories, Engineering titles had the highest (85.7%, or 12 out of 14) and Medical journals had the lowest (25%, or 3 out of 14) proportion of respondents who would always welcome manuscripts derived from open access ETDs. At least 50% of the journals from every type of publishing entity indicated they would  always welcome revised ETDs. However, there are differences between the entities: University Presses were most likely to  always welcome revised ETDs (87.5%), Commercial Publishers were more likely to have some acceptance restrictions (41.7%), and Academic Societies were the most likely entity to  never welcome revised ETDs (12.7%). Lastly, in a comparison of the results of this study with the results from a similar 2013 study conducted on social science, arts and humanities (SS&H) journals, the authors found statistically significant differences (p=0.025, a=0.05) between the editorial policies regarding revised ETDs of science and SS&H journals. Conclusion - The study results suggest that, contrary to common perceptions, the majority of high-impact science journals would actually welcome revised open access ETDs submissions. Therefore, science scholars would not greatly reduce their chances for publishing manuscripts derived from EDTs by making the original ETDs accessible online.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=natscie,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,this is only the review,,"Shen, Lisa",,,,J,,EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE,English,Article,,,,,"[Shen, Lisa] Sam Houston State Univ, Newton Gresham Lib, Reference & Instruct Serv, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA",,1,1,UNIV ALBERTA,1715-720X,,2015,10,3,111,113,10.18438/B8VK58,,,,,2021-01-27

However, this trend has aroused concern about a potentially negative impact on the tradition of open science. Drawing on a survey data of 698 Japanese natural scientists, this study analyzes the behaviors and norms of university scientists under the influence of university interventions for entrepreneurship, whereby examining the compatibility between entrepreneurship and open science. The results indicate that entrepreneurial interventions have facilitated scientists' norm for practical contribution, and consequently, their involvement in commercial activities and ties with industry. Then, some, but not all, of these entrepreneurial activities have deterred cooperative or open relationships between scientists. However, the results suggest that the entrepreneurial interventions have not deteriorated the traditional norm for open science. Further analyses indicate that the two norms for practical contribution and for open science are determined independently, implying that academic entrepreneurship can be promoted without deteriorating open science.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=JPN,focus on nationality not country,,"Shibayama, Sotaro",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER,English,Article,,,,,"[Shibayama, Sotaro] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Shibayama, Sotaro] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Shibayama, Sotaro] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Policy NISTEP, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000013, Japan",,59,17,SPRINGER,0892-9912,,2012,37,4,508,531,10.1007/s10961-010-9202-7,,,,,2021-01-27

Data were collected by advanced search and browse features available at the BASE on document types, the number of repositories by country wise and Indian academic and research repositories. Data were tabulated using MS Excel for further analysis. Findings Findings indicated that open-access repositories across the world are primarily archiving reviewed literature. Grey literature is archived more at European and North American repositories compared to rest of the world. Reports, theses, dissertations and data sets are the major grey document types archived. In India, a significant contributor to the BASE index with 146 open-access sources, reviewed literature is the largest archived document types, and grey literature is above world average due to the presence of theses and dissertations at repositories of academic institutions.

Traditionally, the focus on inequality in scientific publishing has focused on prestige hierarchies in established print journals. This project examines stratification in contemporary publishing with a particular focus on subscription vs. various Open Access (OA) publishing options. Findings show that authors working at lower-ranked universities are more likely to publish in closed/paywalled outlets, and less likely to choose outlets that involve some sort of Article Processing Charge (APCs;  gold or hybrid OA). We also analyze institutional differences and stratification in the APC costs paid in various journals. Authors affiliated with higher-ranked institutions, as well as hospitals and non-profit organizations pay relatively higher APCs for gold and hybrid OA publications. Results suggest that authors affiliated with high-ranked universities and well-funded institutions tend to have more resources to choose pay options with publishing. Our research suggests new professional hierarchies developing in contemporary publishing, where various OA publishing options are becoming increasingly prominent.

Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. Besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. Furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.

2389,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,What inhibits authors to self-archive in Open Access repositories? A Malaysian case,Open Access; self-archiving; institutional repositories; academic authors; universities; Malaysia,"This paper reports on a survey carried out on academics in five Malaysian research-intensive universities, investigating their readiness to self archive in Open Access institutional repositories. The study revolves around the following issues: (a) academics' awareness of self archiving in an institutional repository within their institution; (b) their perceptions about self archiving scientific information into institutional repositories; (c) their perceptions regarding obligations to self archive in institutional repositories; and (d) the possible reasons that inhibit them in contributing to institutional repositories. The answers were identified from 72 academics through a web-based survey. The study reveals that the majority of academics in this study have no or little knowledge of, or experience with, institutional repositories and are unfamiliar with self-archiving opportunities. However most of them endorse the principle of Open Access and are willing to contribute content to an institutional repository if an opportunity arises or if mandated by their funding institutions. Those who agree to self archiving see it to be beneficial in the author's life as it enhances visibility and recognition of the author's work, but the main problem encountered is the fact that researchers feel it is time consuming. The major barrier to self archiving is fear of plagiarism. In light of these results, there is a need to create more awareness and to educate authors on the importance of self archiving. Ensuring free electronic access to public-funded research lies with the funding institutions, especially universities, which should set up appropriate repository infrastructures, advocate the public good and ethical implications of open access and even mandate self-archiving of research they fund.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=MYS,,,"Singeh, Feria Wirba; Abrizah, A.; Karim, Noor Harun Abdul",,,,J,,INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT,English,Article,,,,,"[Singeh, Feria Wirba] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Abrizah, A.; Karim, Noor Harun Abdul] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",,42,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,0266-6669,,2013,29,1,24,35,10.1177/0266666912450450,,,,,2021-01-27
2390,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Open access LIS periodicals and digital archives An evaluation with reference to Asian countries,Electronic journals; Open access LIS periodicals; LIS e-journals; Mapping open access LIS periodicals; Open access - Asia,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report results of a study which investigated the growth of open access (OA) journals across the world with reference to the Asian region. Details of 117 OA journals were collected from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) to determine the geographic distribution, language of publication and growth of periodical year-wise. The study makes detail analysis of four OA periodical published from India, Iran, Pakistan and Taiwan. Pattern of authorship and contribution according to nature of professional work were analyzed. The study reveals that most contributions were made by teaching professionals in comparison to working library and information officers. Single-authored contributions dominated (44 per cent) in all periodicals of the Asian region, indicating low amount of teamwork/collaborative contributions to library and information science (LIS) research by the authors of this region. To know the subject distribution of articles, the study was limited to 27 subfields within the broad spectrum of LIS. Annals of Library and Information Sciences (ALIS) published in India carried the highest number of articles (165) followed by Journal of Library and Information Sciences (JLIS) from Taiwan. The findings of the study also indicate that there is varied distribution of topics within the Asian LIS literature published in OA journals. Most popular areas of writing among authors in OA journals have been found to be bibliometics, webometrics, research productivity or research methods besides information seeking pattern, information need of users and digital libraries. Design/methodology/approach - To gather data for the present investigation, survey of OA e-journals was made across the Web. The collection of data from OA journals and content was accompanied by searching the DOAJ. After selecting the OA journals, these were analyzed using the descriptions on their content page and key words chosen from each contribution. Selection of additional key words, i.e. words not in the title, was also made. Analysis of this data is discussed in this paper. Findings - OA removes restrictions that exist on access to scholarly information and knowledge, it empowers the readers to read, download, distribute and make use of relevant literature, besides giving authors and their work fairly good visibility, readership and impact. The OA movement is gaining importance and the scholarly community is now realizing that tolled or subscribed access is creating a barrier and preventing their work from wider accessibility and readership. A number of journals across the world are now being published in OA mode. The present study attempts to map the growth of LIS literature in OA journals with special reference to periodicals published from Asian countries. The finding of this sample study suggests that many counties are promoting OA journals. While USA ranks first in publication of OA journals in the world. Taiwan publishes the highest number of articles in Asia. Majority of OA journals are published in English, and English appears to be most popular language for communicating research information. Of the four OA LIS journals analyzed in detail, it is observed that single-authored contributions are most popular. Collaborative contributions to LIS research were not so evident among authors of the Asian community. The teaching professionals or LIS teachers contributed the greatest number of articles, except for the Indian journal ALIS, demonstrating that working professional are more actively involved in writing and they outnumber the teaching community. Contributions from research students in all OA journals have been fairly significant. Research students may be encouraged to publish their master's and doctoral research work in OA periodicals for better visibility, readership and impact. The study further reveals that ALIS from India and JLIS from Taiwan carried the highest number of articles. While areas like bibliometrics, webometrics and e-resources and OA are most popular areas of writing among Indian authors, information-seeking pattern, information need, digital and virtual libraries have been popular among authors from Taiwan. Webology from Iran has predominant articles on Web study or evaluation and social networking. Universities and LIS need to come forward to take a need-based approach to LIS research, suggesting ways for improving existing LIS services in their respective countries. To get the correct picture of growth of OA journals in the Asian region, more exhaustive and extensive study may be required. Researchers interested to carry further investigation will have to adopt appropriate measures to overcome the limitations mentioned in the study, for example, the source of data DOAJ may not be very extensive to give correct picture of OA journals. It is likely that some journals may not have been included in this directory. Researchers interested to carry further investigations will have to adopt appropriate measures to overcome these constraints. Research limitations/implications - Scope and limitation access to data and timely completion are the two vital factors for the success and accomplishment of the objectives of any investigation. Hence, considering the vast range of literature from every geographical region and limited time to complete research, the present study adhered to the following limitations. The study covers in its scope literature published in the period of five years (accessed from March 28 to May 25, 2011, only). The study includes only those publications/journals contributed by authors in English. The study includes four OA journals having full-text articles in English, abstracts not included. It considers those publications primarily inclined and relevant to library and information services. The study includes only those OA LIS journals listed or included in DOAJ. Originality/value - The present study has been taken with view to analyze the growth of OA journals in LIS with special reference to Asian countries. While several studies have been conducted on growth and publishing of traditional LIS journals, the present study is perhaps an interesting attempt to make a comprehensive review of the phenomena. The finding of the recent study will be of interest to many LIS professionals, researchers and academicians as it demonstrate the growth of OA journals.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=IR; geo=TW; geo=PK; geo=IN,,,"Singh, Neena; Chikate, Anil",,,,J,,ELECTRONIC LIBRARY,English,Article,,,,,"[Singh, Neena] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Forestry & Hill Agr, Tehri, India; [Chikate, Anil] North Maharastra Univ Jalgaon, Mahrastra, India",,18,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,0264-0473,,2014,32,5,710,725,10.1108/EL-09-2012-0120,,,,,2021-01-27

OpenDOAR provides a quality-assured listing of open access repositories around the world. The findings of the study show that the Indian repositories are also represented in the Ranking of Web Repositories. It also indicates that the trends towards the development of open access repositories are increasing among higher education and research institutions.

There are several initiatives now that persuade researchers to publish in open access journals and to archive their pre- or post-print versions of papers in repositories. Institutions and funding agencies are also promoting ways to make research outputs available as open access. This paper looks at open access levels and patterns in research output from India by computationally analyzing research publication data obtained from Web of Science for India for the last 5 years (2014-2018). The corresponding data from other connected platforms-Unpaywall and Sci-Hub-are also obtained and analyzed. The results obtained show that about 24% of research output from India, during last 5 years, is available in legal forms of open access as compared to world average of about 30%. More articles are available in gold open access as compared to green and bronze. On the contrary, more than 90% of the research output from India is available for free download in Sci-Hub. We also found disciplinary differentiation in open access, but surprisingly these patterns are different for gold-green and black open access forms. Sci-Hub appears to be complementing the legal gold-green open access for less covered disciplines in them.

This is specifically relevant in the emergency medicine field due to the importance of providing immediate care in critical situations as the very current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic is showing to the scientific community. This work aims to show which Emergency Medicine journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports (JCR) currently meet data sharing criteria. (2) Methods: This study analyzes the editorial policies regarding the data deposit of the journals in the emergency medicine category of the JCR and evaluates the Supplementary material of the articles published in these journals that have been deposited in the PubMed Central repository. (3) Results: It has been observed that 19 out of the 24 journals contained in the emergency medicine category of Journal Citation Reports are also located in PubMed Central (PMC), yielding a total of 5983 articles. Out of these, only 9.4% of the articles contain supplemental material. Although second quartile journals of JCR emergency medicine category have quantitatively more articles in PMC, the main journals involved in the deposit of supplemental material belong to the first quartile, of which the most used format in the articles is pdf, followed by text documents. (4) Conclusion: This study reveals that data sharing remains an incipient practice in the emergency medicine field, as there are still barriers between researchers to participate in data sharing. Therefore, it is necessary to promote dynamics to improve this practice both qualitatively (the quality and format of datasets) and quantitatively (the quantity of datasets in absolute terms) in research.",a=openaccess;  a=opendata,m=document review,d=med,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Sixto-Costoya, Andrea;  Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael;  Lucas-Dominguez, Rut;  Vidal-Infer, Antonio",,,,J,,DATA,English,Article,,,,,"[Sixto-Costoya, Andrea;  Lucas-Dominguez, Rut;  Vidal-Infer, Antonio] Univ Valencia, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Hist Sci & Informat Sci, Valencia 46010, Spain;  [Sixto-Costoya, Andrea;  Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael;  Lucas-Dominguez, Rut;  Vidal-Infer, Antonio] UISYS, Joint Res Unit CSIC Univ Valencia, Valencia 46003, Spain;  [Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael] Ingenio CSIC Politech Univ Valencia, Valencia 46022, Spain",,24,2,MDPI,,,2020,5,2,,,10.3390/data5020028,,,,,2021-01-27

It also seeks to explore existing open science practices, ascertain the level of participation of academic libraries in open science activities, identify the strategies used in marketing open science platforms and enumerate the challenges hindering the success of open science in the selected countries. The study was guided by the qualitative school of thought where the researcher builds a complex, holistic picture, analyses words, and reports detailed views of informants, and conducts the study in a natural setting. The study employed the multiple case study research design approach to assess how academic libraries in Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda promote open science. The findings show that there are few scholarly journals which exist in open access for most African academies in Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. Though not massively adopted, open access institutional repositories have been used to preserve and publicize the digital contents in some academic institutions in Africa such as theses, dissertations, administrative and heritage materials, conference proceedings as well as pre-prints and post-print of journal articles. The study recommends the intensification of open science advocacy in academic libraries in Sub-Saharan Africa; institutions should ensure that there is a stable electricity supply as well as reliable internet connectivity, introducing regular training on emerging media technologies to the community members and strengthening the libraries consortium in Sub-Saharan Africa as an enabling platform to share intellectual productivity of their member countries.",a=openscience,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=librarian; t=university,geo=GHA; geo=NGA; geo=TZA; geo=UGA,,,"Siyao, Peter Onauphoo; Whong, Fidelia M.; Martin-Yeboah, Ebenezer; Namamonde, Annet",,,,J,,IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS,English,Article,,,,,"[Siyao, Peter Onauphoo] Mzumbe Univ, POB 4, Mzumbe, Tanzania; [Whong, Fidelia M.] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Kashim Ibrahimu Lib, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria; [Martin-Yeboah, Ebenezer] Univ Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Namamonde, Annet] Uganda Christian Univ, Mukono Town, Uganda",,50,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,0340-0352,,2017,43,3,242,255,10.1177/0340035217712263,,,,,2021-01-27
2402,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,Open science and modified funding lotteries can impede the natural selection of bad science,open science;  funding;  replication;  reproducibility;  cultural evolution,"Assessing scientists using exploitable metrics can lead to the degradation of research methods even without any strategic behaviour on the part of individuals, via 'the natural selection of bad science.' Institutional incentives to maximize metrics like publication quantity and impact drive this dynamic. Removing these incentives is necessary, but institutional change is slow. However, recent developments suggest possible solutions with more rapid onsets. These include what we call open science improvements, which can reduce publication bias and improve the efficacy of peer review. In addition, there have been increasing calls for funders to move away from prestige- or innovation-based approaches in favour of lotteries. We investigated whether such changes are likely to improve the reproducibility of science even in the presence of persistent incentives for publication quantity through computational modelling. We found that modified lotteries, which allocate funding randomly among proposals that pass a threshold for methodological rigour, effectively reduce the rate of false discoveries, particularly when paired with open science improvements that increase the publication of negative results and improve the quality of peer review. In the absence of funding that targets rigour, open science improvements can still reduce false discoveries in the published literature but are less likely to improve the overall culture of research practices that underlie those publications.",a=openscience,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=university;  t=policy;  t=funder,geo=nonspecific,,,"Smaldino, Paul E.;  Turner, Matthew A.;  Kallens, Pablo A.

Using ""open access"" to extend the reach and richness of faculty research within a university",Academic libraries;  Academic staff;  Digital libraries;  Digital storage;  User studies,"Purpose - This paper aims to clarify the relationship between researcher, digital librarian, and cataloger supporting collection building in institutional repository (IR). It also aims to propose modeling the collaborative process and outline why and how cooperative partnership is important throughout the IR content building process. The study seeks to contribute to the body of knowledge of IR collection building by including a faculty-centered approach and level of data curation aspects than is normally found in IR content building literature. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an experimental approach of IR collection building, including several interviews and one expert group discussion with faculty representing the department of anthropology. The data were complemented by digital collection description and accessibility in IR, online public access catalog (OPAC) and OCLC WorldCat. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how faculty contribution is brought about during IR content building. It suggests that digital librarians act as ""integrating forces"" on two levels: integrating the elements of level of data curation for digital objects representation and discoverability, and mediating between digital objects description and the researcher. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack general application. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test proposed propositions further. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of a mature and fully realized IR, the development of ""data curators"" and for managing the balance between participation and content.

2406,SCOPUS,maike_neufend,"Knowledge sharing in global health research - the impact, uptake and cost of open access to scholarly literature",Open access;  Global health research;  Knowledge translation;  Publication ethics;  Research impact;  Research capacity;  Publication policy,"Background: In 1982, the Annals of Virology published a paper showing how Liberia has a highly endemic potential of Ebola warning health authorities of the risk for potential outbreaks;  this journal is only available by subscription. Limiting the accessibility of such knowledge may have reduced information propagation toward public health actors who were indeed surprised by and unprepared for the 2014 epidemic. Open access (OA) publication can allow for increased access to global health research (GHR). Our study aims to assess the use, cost and impact of OA diffusion in the context of GHR. Method: A total of 3366 research articles indexed under the Medical Heading Subject Heading Global Health published between 2010 and 2014 were retrieved using PubMed to (1) quantify the uptake of various types of OA, (2) estimate the article processing charges (APCs) of OA, and (3) analyse the relationship between different types of OA, their scholarly impact and gross national income per capita of citing countries. Results: Most GHR publications are not available directly on the journal's website (69%). Further, 60.8% of researchers do not self-archive their work even when it is free and in keeping with journal policy. The total amount paid for APCs was estimated at US$1.7 million for 627 papers, with authors paying on average US$2732 per publication;  94% of APCs were paid to journals owned by the ten most prominent publication houses from high-income countries. Researchers from low-and middle-income countries are generally citing less expensive types of OA, while researchers in high-income countries are citing the most expensive OA. Conclusions: Although OA may help in building global research capacity in GHR, the majority of publications remain subscription only. It is logical and cost-efficient for institutions and researchers to promote OA by self-archiving publications of restricted access, as it not only allows research to be cited by a broader audience, it also augments citation rates. Although OA does not ensure full knowledge transfer from research to practice, limiting public access can negatively impact implementation and outcomes of health policy and reduce public understanding of health issues.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=med,t=researcher;  t=university,geo=nonspecific,,,"Smith, Elise;  Haustein, Stefanie;  Mongeon, Philippe;  Shu, Fei;  Ridde, Valery;  Lariviere, Vincent",,,,J,,HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS,English,Article,,,,,"[Smith, Elise;  Haustein, Stefanie;  Mongeon, Philippe;  Lariviere, Vincent] Univ Montreal, Ecole Bibliothecon & Sci lInformat, Montreal, PQ, Canada;  [Smith, Elise] Med Sociale & Prevent, Sci Humaines Appl Opt Bioth, Montreal, PQ, Canada;  [Shu, Fei] McGill Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada;  [Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Dept Med Sociale & Prevent, Ecole Sante Publ, Montreal, PQ, Canada;  [Lariviere, Vincent] Univ Qubec Montreal, Observ Sci & Technol OST CIRST, Montreal, PQ, Canada;  [Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Inst Rech Sante Publ IRSPUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,53,19,BMC,1478-4505,,2017,15,,,,10.1186/s12961-017-0235-3,,,,28851401,2021-01-27

Additional information about the journal and the authors' country were obtained from the journal website. A total of 429 (41%) authors from 69 journals completed the survey. There were large differences in the source of funding among disciplines. Journals with impact factors charged higher APCs as did journals from disciplines where grant funding is plentiful. Fit, quality, and speed of publication were the most important factors in the authors' choice of a journal.

Two-year citation averages for journals funded by Article Processing Charges (APCs) have reached the same level as subscription journals. Citation averages of OA journals funded by other means continue to lag well behind OA journals funded by APCs and subscription journals.

Open access (OA) publishing via article processing charges (APCs) is growing as an alternative to subscription publishing. The Pay It Forward (PIF) Project is exploring the feasibility of transitioning from paying subscriptions to funding APCs for faculty at research intensive universities. Estimating of the cost of APCs for the journals authors at research intensive universities tend to publish is essential for the PIF project and similar initiatives. This paper presents our research into this question. Methods. We identified APC prices for publications by authors at the 4 research intensive United States (US) and Canadian universities involved in the study. We also obtained APC payment records from several Western European universities and funding agencies. Both data sets were merged with Web of Science (WoS) metadata. We calculated the average APCs for articles and proceedings in 13 discipline categories published by researchers at research intensive universities. We also identified 41 journals published by traditionally subscription publishers which have recently converted to APC funded OA and recorded the APCs they charge. Results. We identified 7,629 payment records from the 4 European APC payment databases and 14,356 OA articles authored by PIF partner university faculty for which we had listed APC prices. APCs for full OA journals published by PIF authors averaged 1,775 USD; full OA journal APCs paid by Western European funders averaged 1,865 USD; hybrid APCs paid by Western European funders averaged 2,887 USD. The APC for converted journals published by major subscription publishers averaged 1,825 USD. APC funded OA is concentrated in the life and basic sciences. APCs funded articles in the social sciences and humanities are often multidisciplinary and published in journals such as PLOS ONE that largely publish in the life sciences. Conclusions. Full OA journal APCs average a little under 2,000 USD while hybrid articles average about 3,000 USD for publications by researchers at research intensive universities. There is a lack of information on discipline differences in APCs due to the concentration of APC funded publications in a few fields and the multidisciplinary nature of research.",a=openaccess;  a=openpolicies,m=document review,d=med; d=nonspecific,t=publisher; t=university,geo=USA; geo=CND,"uses data of  three APC repositories in EU and WoS-data of journals;

In a metric-wise scientific milieu, it would be probable that authors tend to select citation-attractive topics especially when choosing open access (OA) outlets that are more likely to attract citations. Applying a matched-pairs study design, this research aims to examine the role of research topics in the citation advantage of OA papers. Using a comparative citation analysis method, it investigates a sample of papers published in 47 Elsevier article processing charges (APC)-funded journals in different access models including non-open access (NOA), APC, Green and mixed Green-APC. The contents of the papers are analysed using natural language processing techniques at the title and abstract level and served as a basis to match the NOA papers to their peers in the OA models. The publication years and journals are controlled for in order to avoid their impacts on the citation numbers. According to the results, the OA citation advantage that is observed in the whole sample still holds even for the highly similar OA and NOA papers. This implies that the OA citation surplus is not an artefact of the OA and NOA papers' differences in their topics and, therefore, in their citation potential. This leads to the conclusion that OA authors' self-selectivity, if it exists at all, is not responsible for the OA citation advantage, at least as far as selection of topics with probably higher citation potentials is concerned.",a=openaccess,m=other; m=document review; m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Sotudeh, Hajar",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE,English,Article,,,,,"[Sotudeh, Hajar] Shiraz Univ, Fac Educ & Psychol, Dept Knowledge & Informat Sci, Shiraz, Iran",,86,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,0165-5515,,2020,46,5,696,709,10.1177/0165551519865489,,,,,2021-01-27

The comparative citation analysis of the older articles (published in 2007-2011) in the two mentioned citation windows indicated that they sustained their citation advantage in comparison with the toll-access ones. The citation advantage was also confirmed for more recent APC-funded OA articles (published in 2012-2015). Therefore, the passage of time did not seem to affect the citation gap between APC-funded OA and toll-access articles, and the citation advantage of the APC-funded OA articles was apparently a sustainable phenomenon.

2430,SCOPUS,markus_konkol; stefan_skupien,“Let the community decide”? The vision and reality of soundness-only peer review in open-access mega-journals,Economics; Electronic journals; Electronic publishing; Free publications; Journal publishers; Publishing,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to better understand the theory and practice of peer review in open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). OAMJs typically operate a “soundness-only” review policy aiming to evaluate only the rigour of an article, not the novelty or significance of the research or its relevance to a particular community, with these elements being left for “the community to decide” post-publication. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports the results of interviews with 31 senior publishers and editors representing 16 different organisations, including 10 that publish an OAMJ. Thematic analysis was carried out on the data and an analytical model developed to explicate their significance. Findings: Findings suggest that in reality criteria beyond technical or scientific soundness can and do influence editorial decisions. Deviations from the original OAMJ model are both publisher supported (in the form of requirements for an article to be “worthy” of publication) and practice driven (in the form of some reviewers and editors applying traditional peer review criteria to OAMJ submissions). Also publishers believe post-publication evaluation of novelty, significance and relevance remains problematic. Originality/value: The study is based on unprecedented access to senior publishers and editors, allowing insight into their strategic and operational priorities. The paper is the first to report in-depth qualitative data relating specifically to soundness-only peer review for OAMJs, shedding new light on the OAMJ phenomenon and helping inform discussion on its future role in scholarly communication. The paper proposes a new model for understanding the OAMJ approach to quality assurance, and how it is different from traditional peer review. © 2018, © Valerie Spezi, Simon Wakeling, Stephen Pinfield, Jenny Fry, Claire Creaser and Peter Willett.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Spezi V., Wakeling S., Pinfield S., Fry J., Creaser C., Willett P.",,,,,,Journal of Documentation,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,19,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,220418,0,2018,74,1,137,161,10.1108/JD-06-2017-0092,,,,,2021-01-27

The paper seeks to explore authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to authors' peer-reviewed accepted manuscripts in open access repositories. Design/methodology/approach - The research was undertaken using a mixed-method approach, involving the distribution of a survey by the 12 participating publishers to their authors in selected journal titles and a participatory workshop with European researchers from selected disciplinary areas. Findings - Researchers' attitudes towards versions of published journal articles made open access via open access repositories may vary depending on whether researchers report behaviours from the perspective of an author or a reader. The research found that disciplinary cultures, norms and traditions shape authors' self-archiving behaviour and readers' use of those versions of journal articles held in repositories. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of the research is that it was impossible for the research team to gauge the representativeness of the survey compared to the actual disciplinary distribution of the population of EU researchers, as such population information is not available in an aggregated and consistent format. Originality/value - The PEER Observatory is an unprecedented large-scale collaboration between publishers, researchers and repositories to investigate the effects of self-archiving at European level. The paper provides a disciplinary reading of the findings and augments the understanding of how disciplinary culture and norms shape authors' and readers' behaviours in relation to self-archiving.",a=openaccess,m=survey; m=interview,d=natscie; d=soscie; d=med: d=hum,t=researcher; t=publisher,geo=EU,add d=interdisciplinary,,"Spezi, Valerie; Fry, Jenny; Creaser, Claire; Probets, Steve; White, Sonya",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION,English,Article,,,,,"[Spezi, Valerie; Creaser, Claire; White, Sonya] Univ Loughborough, LISU, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Fry, Jenny; Probets, Steve] Univ Loughborough, Dept Informat Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England",,30,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,0022-0418,,2013,69,3,334,359,10.1108/JD-01-2012-0008,,,,,2021-01-27

The paywall barriers to access of knowledge has become so problematic that even institutions in the developed countries are not only cancelling subscriptions but also mandating it for their researchers to either publish in open access journals or at least deposit their research papers in Institutional Repositories. The high subscription cost of journals is a more serious issue for developing countries, as it takes away institutional resources that can be used for other productive purposes. India has taken several steps in promoting open access, including release of an open access policy by Ministry of Science and Technology, however, it is not very clear that how effective these initiatives have been. This paper intends to address this issue. It examines published output, indexed in Web of Science, from 100 most productive institutions in India and analyze how much research output coming from them are available in Open Access (OA). The paper further analyzes availability of research papers from these institutions in the popular pirate site Sci-Hub. It is interesting to observe that legal OA percentages are significantly lesser than the Sci-Hub availability for all the institutions, an indication that the existing systems for promoting open access in India are not working efficiently. At the end, the paper also presents statistics about number of papers deposited in three central institutional repositories in India. These statistics provides an indication of the extent to which these repositories have been able to promote open access in India.

Growing international attention has turned to learning and teaching resources, particularly textbooks as a key barrier to fully engaging with, and participating in, higher education. The affordances of open texts provide an alternative to commercially published and often exclusionary access practices; and empower educators and students in co-creation and open sharing of information and knowledge. This paper examines the design of an ongoing institutional grants program predicated on a facilitated community learning approach for academic staff seeking to adopt, or adapt open textbooks into the curriculum as one mechanism to increase access to information. The participants' experiences and personal learning were captured through a series of semi-structured interviews that inform the iterative design of the ongoing grants program that could be transferred to other institutions seeking to support educational change.

2443,SCOPUS,markus_konkol; stefan_skupien,"A retrospective analysis of submissions, acceptance rate, open peer review operations, and prepublication bias of the multidisciplinary open access journal Head & Face Medicine",0,"Background: Head & Face Medicine (HFM) was launched in August 2005 to provide multidisciplinar/ science in the field of head and face disorders with an open access and open peer review publication platform. The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of submissions, the effectiveness of open peer reviewing, and factors biasing the acceptance or rejection of submitted manuscripts. Methods: A I-year period of submissions and all concomitant journal operations were retrospectively analyzed. The analysis included submission rate, reviewer rate, acceptance rate, article type, and differences in duration for peer reviewing, final decision, publishing, and PubMed inclusion. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, regression analysis, and binary logistic regression. Results: HFM received 126 articles (10.5 articles/month) for consideration in the first year. Submissions have been increasing, but not significantly over time. Peer reviewing was completed for 82 articles and resulted in an acceptance rate of 48.8%. In total, 431 peer reviewers were invited (5.3/manuscript), of which 40.4% agreed to review. The mean peer review time was 37.8 days. The mean time between submission and acceptance (including time for revision) was 95.9 days. Accepted papers were published on average 99.3 days after submission. The mean time between manuscript submission and PubMed inclusion was 101.3 days. The main article types submitted to HFM were original research, reviews, and case reports. The article type had no influence on rejection or acceptance. The variable 'number of invited reviewers' was the only significant (p < 0.05) predictor for rejection of manuscripts. Conclusion: The positive trend in submissions confirms the need for publication platforms for multidisciplinary science. HFM's peer review time comes in shorter than the 6-weeks turnaround time the Editors set themselves as the maximum. Rejection of manuscripts was associated with the number of invited reviewers. None of the other parameters tested had any effect on the final decision. Thus, HFM's ethical policy, which is based on Open Access, Open Peer, and transparency of journal operations, is free of 'editorial bias' in accepting manuscripts.

We examine doctoral students' awareness of and attitudes to open access forms of publication. Levels of awareness of open access and the concept of institutional repositories, publishing behaviour and perceptions of benefits and risks of open access publishing were explored. Method. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through interviews with eight doctoral students enrolled in a range of disciplines in a New Zealand university and a self-completion Web survey of 251 students. Analysis. Interview data were analysed thematically, then evaluated against a theoretical framework. The interview data were then used to inform the design of the survey tool. Survey responses were analysed as a single set, then by disciple using SurveyMonkey's online toolkit and Excel. Results. While awareness of open access and repository archiving is still low, the majority of interview and survey respondents were found to be supportive of the concept of open access. The perceived benefits of enhanced exposure and potential for sharing outweigh the perceived risks. The majority of respondents were supportive of an existing mandatory thesis submission policy.

The data creators and data services expressed a high level of awareness about data quality issues, especially in relation to good publication potential. Barriers to ensuring the greater accessibility of data in the future include the little recognition and reputation for doing the related extra work involved in preparing data and documentation, the need for financial rewards for such additional work, and the undeveloped culture of data exchange in general. The motivation to provide open access to such data will involve a combination of requirements prescribed for data delivery, and the provision of support services and financial rewards, in particular changing the views held by the professional scientific community about the benefits of open data for research activities. © 2012 Author.",a=opendata,m=interview,d=nonspecific,t=researcher; t=librarian,geo=SVN,,,Štebe J.,,,,,,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,English,Conference Paper,"12th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, JCDL '12",10 June 2012 through 14 June 2012,"Washington, DC",,,,,0,0,15525996,9781450311540,2012,0,0,401,402,10.1145/2232817.2232911,,,,,2021-01-27

2456,SCOPUS,markus_konkol; stefan_skupien,When are researchers willing to share their data? – Impacts of values and uncertainty on open data in academia,0,"Background E-science technologies have significantly increased the availability of data. Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. Methods and findings In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers’ acceptance of open data–the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers’ intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. Conclusions Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers’ assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels. © 2020 Stieglitz et al.

Do biomedical journals differ from the journals from other disciplines in that respect? Our hypothesis was that biomedical journals maintain much higher publication ethics standards. Materials and methods: This study looked at 197 Croatian OA journals Instructions to authors to address the following groups of ethical issues: general terms; guidelines and recommendations; research approval and registration; funding and conflict of interest; peer review; redundant publications, misconduct and retraction; copyright; timeliness; authorship; and data accessibility. We further compared a subset of 159 non-biomedical journals with a subset of 38 biomedical journals. Content analysis was used to discern the ethical issues representation in the instructions to authors. Results: The groups of biomedical and non-biomedical journals were similar in terms of originality (chi(2) = 2.183, P = 0.140), peer review process (chi(2) = 0.296, P = 0.586), patent/grant statement (chi(2) = 2.184, P = 0.141), and timeliness of publication (chi(2) = 0.369, P = 0.544). We identified significant differences among categories including ethical issues typical for the field of biomedicine, like patients (chi(2) = 47.111, P < 0.001), and use of experimental animals (chi(2) = 42.543, P < 0.001). Biomedical journals also rely on international editorial guidelines formulated by relevant professional organizations heavily, compared with non-biomedical journals (chi(2) = 42.666, P < 0.001).

Among other characteristics of predatory journals two most relevant are their business model and the quality of the editorial work. Materials and methods: We analysed 444 Croatian open access (OA) journals in the Hrtak (portal of Croatian scientific journals) digital journal repository for the presence of article processing charges as a business model and the transparency of editorial policies. Results: The majority of journals do not charge authors or require submission or article processing charges, which clearly distinguishes them from predatory journals. Almost all Hrtak OA journals have publicly available information on editorial boards, including full names and affiliations, and detailed contact information for the editorial office at the Hrtak website. The journal names are unique and cannot be easily confused with another journal or intend to mislead about the journal's origin. While most journals provide information on peer review process, many do not provide guidelines for reviewers or other editorial and publication ethics standards.

One of the important parameters that restrict our HEIs from the list of top-notch global HEIs is 'contribution to research'. It does not mean that Indian HEIs don't have quality researchers to produce world class research output. Had that been the case, Indian researchers doing research abroad would not have done miracles with their unique research output in varied domains. The hindrance for researchers in India could be owing to improper communication facility that fails to exchange ideas and outcomes of research among peers. Thus, the urge for formation of sound institutional electronic repositories, i.e., electronic research corners (e-research corners) has crop up. Mere formation of e-research corners won't suffice to address the issue. Besides formation, e-research corners need to be open accessed. University Grants Commission (UGC) of India has established an Inter-University Center called Information and Library Network Center (Inflibnet), which is the best example of open access institutional repositories. While some HEIs of India do have their research corners that are accessed by only the internal stakeholders, some other HEIs don't have any such repositories as such. On the backdrop of the necessity of formation and open access of institutional electronic repositories, this paper focuses on unfolding how open access to sound e-research corners promote quality education. Besides, it has also designed a framework that will assist the HEIs to build sound e-research centers. For the purpose, in-depth interviews are conducted with 50 researchers working in reputed HEIs in Bhubaneswar to ascertain how open access e-research centers facilitate quality research. Focus Group Discussion are also conducted among experts in the field like research heads of selected HEIs, Chief Librarians of established Libraries and reputed educationists of the State for designing the framework to form e-research centers.

Publishing in these journals could negatively impact faculty reputation, promotion, and tenure, yet many still choose to do so. Therefore, the authors investigated faculty knowledge and attitudes regarding predatory OA journals. Methods: A twenty-item questionnaire containing both quantitative and qualitative items was developed and piloted. All university and medical school faculty were invited to participate. The survey included knowledge questions that assessed respondents' ability to identify predatory OA journals and attitudinal questions about such journals. Chi-square tests were used to detect differences between university and medical faculty. Results: A total of 183 faculty completed the survey: 63% were university and 37% were medical faculty. Nearly one-quarter (23%) had not previously heard of the term predatory OA journal. Most (87%) reported feeling very confident or confident in their ability to assess journal quality, but only 60% correctly identified a journal as predatory, when given a journal in their field to assess. Chi-square tests revealed that university faculty were more likely to correctly identify a predatory OA journal (p=0.0006) and have higher self-reported confidence in assessing journal quality, compared with medical faculty (p=0.0391).

Online learning environments are replacing or enhancing many physical classrooms within higher education, but these learning environments are not necessarily free, open-access, or publicly available on the open web. Considering two organizations that host free and open websites available to use by any member of the public, this study demonstrates how open-access and public-facing pedagogy on the web is in-line with student-centered practices. Network analysis, website structure, content analysis, and surveys suggest that students can be equally and potentially more empowered as practitioners in their own education by sharing their knowledge-building with a wider audience on the open web. Open web communities can enable student-centered pedagogy practices to freely evolve outside of a hierarchical and institutional structure, and can work to further studentcentered goals through producing knowledge for anyone to access and contribute to on the open web. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",a=openaccess; a=openeducation,m=other; m=document review; m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=nonspecific,article is paywalled,,Tagliaferri L.,,,,,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,English,Conference Paper,"19th International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning, ICL 2016",21 September 2016 through 23 September 2016,0,,,,,0,Springer Verlag,21945357,9783319503394,2017,545,0,605,619,10.1007/978-3-319-50340-0_54,,,,,2021-01-27

However, it remains a contentious issue with continued debate as to its impact on the peer-review process and a potential change in the quality of subsequent evidence published. There is little research that looks into OA in oral and maxillofacial surgery. We investigated the OA policy in the 30 relevant journals listed in the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge journal citation report, comparing bibliometric data and quality of evidence produced in journals offering OA and those with subscription-only policies. 3474 articles were graded for evidence level and the results correlated to journal OA status. 76.7 % of journals offered authors OA services. There was no difference between impact factor, self-citation rate, total citations or quality of evidence between OA and subscription journals. These findings should send clear messages to both clinicians and researchers and should re- assure readers that scientific findings that are disseminated in open access form do not differ in quality to those in subscription-only format.

Such an impact may be more pronounced in developing countries where the cost for journal subscription is comparably expensive and usually unaffordable. By comparing one OA article with one non-OA article published in the same issue, we tested the impact of OA on citation advantages of articles published in 46 ecology journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). We compared OA to non-OA articles published in the same issue of these journals, thereby controlling for potentially confounding effects of publication requirement and period. OA articles received significantly more citations than non-OA articles, and this citation advantage of approximately one citation per year was sustained across publication years from 2009 to 2013. The OA citation advantage did not depend upon income of the country of origin of the citing scientists, and the OA citation advantage was found for citing scientists from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, but not for Latin America. A total of 10 countries contributed more than 1000 citations each, and the OA citation advantage was found in all the 10 countries except Canada. Therefore, in ecology journals OA confers articles with citation advantages and such an impact accumulates with years and independent of the economic status of the countries.

Hence, the adoption of open access (OA) institutional repositories (IR) by the institutions to increase access, availability and visibility of their research output to a wider readership. Institutional repository (IR) technologies have transformed the traditional academic library practice, thus upsetting the work culture of librarians. Though studies there have been studies on the impact of IRs on academic librarians elsewhere in the world, none have been done on the Zimbabwean context. This study draws from a wider study which explored utilisation of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities. The study sought to answer the question: What is the role of the academic librarian in promoting the institutional repository? The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) informed the study, while a mixed methods approach was employed using document analysis, questionnaires and interviews to collect data from librarians in eight public universities. Findings revealed that in some instances IR responsibilities were added to existing duties for incumbent staff while in others, staff were reassigned to IR roles resulting in diverse staff categories maintaining the IRs across the universities. Recommendations for effective and efficient management of the repositories by the universities are made.

However, electronic publication providing free access to research via the internet is more than a decade older, was invented in the 1990s and driven by parts of the scientific community. This paper focuses on two disciplines (astronomy and mathematics) in which green OA is well established. It asks how authors and readers use the central disciplinary repository and how they are thereby included in the communication system of their disciplines. Drawing on an interview study with 20 scientists from both disciplines, we analyze the main characteristics of an inclusion, possible problems that result from it and how they are being solved. The empirical results show that there is a complementarity between the routines of authors and readers that co-stabilize each other.

There has been limited examination of the effect of OA on online sharing for journal articles, and little for books. This paper examines the altmetrics of a set of 32,222 books (of which 5% are OA) and a set of 220,527 chapters (of which 7% are OA) indexed by the scholarly database Dimensions in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Both OA books and chapters have significantly higher use on social networks, higher coverage in the mass media and blogs, and evidence of higher rates of social impact in policy documents. OA chapters have higher rates of coverage on Wikipedia than their non-OA equivalents, and are more likely to be shared on Mendeley. Even within the Humanities and Social Sciences, disciplinary differences in altmetric activity are evident. The effect is confirmed for chapters, although sampling issues prevent the strong conclusion that OA facilitates extra attention at the whole book level, the apparent OA altmetrics advantage suggests that the move towards OA is increasing social sharing and broader impact.",a=openaccess,m=other; m=biblio,d=socscie; d=hum,t=researcher; t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,m=other=altmetrics,,"Taylor, Michael",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Taylor, Michael] Univ Wolverhampton, Digital Sci, Wolverhampton, England",,66,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,125,3,2523,2543,10.1007/s11192-020-03735-8,,,,,2021-01-27

This study contributes to current efforts to raise awareness of the LIS OA literature by focusing on the characteristics of journals publishing under an open access gold model. To understand the characteristics of LIS OAJs, 65 English language LIS journals were analyzed via descriptive statistical analysis and summative qualitative content analysis. Along these lines, the study updates and extends previous efforts to describe these journals and their practices. Findings suggest there are several key publication characteristics and commonly represented subject areas in the landscape of active LIS OAJs. Implications for practice include the recognition of the growing diversity of subjects and target audiences, the central role of double-blind peer review in LIS OA, and the acknowledgement that consistency and interoperability among OAJs remains a challenge that may undermine goals for dissemination. © 2017, Emmanuel Edward Te, Frances Owens, Megan Lohnash, Janice Christen-Whitney and Kristen Radsliff Rebmann.",a=openaccess,m=other,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,d=natscie=LIS; geo neets specification with 65 titles,,"Te E.E., Owens F., Lohnash M., Christen-Whitney J., Rebmann K.R.",,,,,,Webology,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,4,University of Tehran,1735188X,0,2017,14,1,8,20,,,,,,2021-01-27

OAMJs are thus able to accommodate a surge in submissions, or transfers from other journals within the same publisher’s fleet. OAMJs represent a simple but effective publishing model that can also be an effective business model. We question whether the peer review system is robust enough to accommodate for effective post-publication peer review in OAMJs. As examples, we examine Scientific Reports, PLOS One, Heliyon, F1000Research, PeerJ, and BMJ Open, as well as a possible developing OAMJ, eLife, for clues to the dynamics of OAMJs and the possible links to quality control via peer review or post-publication peer review.

Recently, the announcement of 'Plan S' has catalysed a new wave of interest, debate, and practice surrounding OA. Here, we provide a simple overview of the 'OA status' of palaeontology journals within this rapidly shifting landscape. In particular, we focus on aspects such as whether or not there are author-facing charges for Open Access, what embargo periods or restrictions on 'self-archiving' policies are in place, and whether or not the sharing of preprints is permitted. The majority of journals have self-archiving policies that allow authors to share their peer reviewed work via 'green OA' without charge. There is a clear relationship between 'journal impact' and higher charges levied for OA. The most expensive journals are typically published by the large, commercial, publishing houses, rather than the palaeontology community themselves. However, there are a number of article processing charge (APC)-free (diamond) OA journals that can also be considered to be of moderate impact. Until the palaeontology community makes the decision to move away from journal-based evaluation criteria (e.g., the impact factor), it is likely that such high costs will continue to impose financial inequities upon the research community.

Design: Web-based survey questionnaire combined with multiple regression analysis. Settings: The research was conducted online using surveys emailed to potential participants at not-for-profit public and private academic institutions in the United States with a FTE of greater than 1000. Subjects: Academic library directors at selected colleges and universities. Methods: Using directory information from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and filtering institutions according to not-for-profit status, size, and special focus, a survey sample of 1135 colleges and universities was obtained. Library websites were used to acquire contact information for library directors. In summer 2012 the 43-item survey questionnaire was distributed to respondents online using Qualtrics. The four primary variables were each comprised of multiple questionnaire items and validated using factor analysis, and the data was explored using multiple regression. Main Results: The survey received 298 respondents for a 26% response rate, though the number of incomplete responses is not stated. Among four stakeholder groups (faculty, publishers, librarians, and senior academic administrators), library directors perceived librarians as having the greatest influence in regards to the adoption of open access (mean = .7056), followed by faculty (.3792), administrators (.1881), and publishers as having a negative impact (-.3684). A positive correlative relationship was determined between Administrator Attention to Open Access-a key variable operationalized by combining eight questionnaire items-and the variables Librarian Commitment to Open Access, Faculty Commitment to Open Access, and Faculty Proclivity Toward Open Access, with the latter especially the case at lower levels of administrator support. Regarding institution size, library directors perceived a higher likelihood of faculty adherence and librarian commitment to OA at large institutions (over 20,000). A given institution's public or private status and geographic region were not significant predictors of faculty or librarian commitment or adherence to open access. Conclusions: The study finds that academic library directors perceive librarians to have the strongest influence upon adoption of open access, and senior academic administrator attention to open access is positively linked to the OA activities of faculty and librarians. Larger institutions are considered to have greater commitment to OA, potentially due to differing missions according to institution type. The authors recommend that open access advocates consider administrator roles and target administrator support when seeking to increase participation in OA. © 2014 Tewell.",a=openaccess,m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=librarian,geo=USA,,,Tewell E.C.,,,,,,Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,0,University of Alberta,1715720X,0,2014,9,3,80,82,10.18438/b8003w,,,,,2021-01-27

The aim of this paper was to describe whether Emergency Medicine trainees in different contexts know about Free Open Access Medical Education, whether or not they know about its different platforms, which ones they use, and what the major barriers to regular usage are. Methods A convenience sample was surveyed on awareness and use of Free Open Access Medical Education blogs, podcasts, websites and Twitter at three institutions (in Australia, Botswana and Papua New Guinea) and one deanery (United Kingdom) between June 2013 and June 2014 using an online survey tool or via hand-distributed survey. Results 44 trainees responded: four from Botswana, seven from Papua New Guinea, ten from the United Kingdom and 23 from Australia. 82% were aware of blogs, 80% of websites, 75% of podcasts and 61% of Twitter as resources in Emergency Medicine. Awareness and use of specific resources were lower in Botswana and Papua New Guinea. For blogs, podcasts and websites, trainees who had looked at a resource at least once were neutral or agreed that it was relevant.

Emerging countries need to keep publishing as well as adopt open access to catch up with the changes. Using exclusive data from the Social Sciences & Humanities Peer Awards (SSHPA) database, the study employed both descriptive statistics and a Bayesian linear regression model to examine the journals and publishers in which Vietnamese social scientists published during the period 2008-2019, and the potential of pursuing the OA movement in Vietnam. We found an increasing diversification in the publishing sources of Vietnamese social science researchers with growth rates of 9.8% and 14.1% per annum in the number of publishers and journals, respectively. Given that the proportion of Gold OA articles had a fourfold increase over the examined period, it seems that the Vietnamese academic community is adopting OA. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis results hint at positive associations of internal and external collaborative power (number of domestic and foreign authors, respectively) with the decision to publish in OA (beta(b_TotalVN_OpenAccess) = 0.22; beta(b_TotalForeign_OpenAccess) = 0.15).

A total of 16 articles published in scholarly journals since 2002 (when the Budapest Open Access Initiative was released) were included in the study and five major themes emerged from their examination and analysis. The literature indicates that attitudes and perceptions of OA are varied across countries and across disciplines. Free access, which is perceived to facilitate wider dissemination of research outputs, is a strong incentive for publishing in OA. However, quality and reputation are the most important factors in selecting a journal and take priority over the availability of free access. Although OA is perceived to have many advantages over the traditional publication model, it raises some concerns too, especially in regard to the author-pays model, the quality of peer-review and the impact of the journals. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.",a=openaccess,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,"literature review; t=not clear which group is also included in analysed studies, see table 1 in article - Conference paper preceding article #2554 with no change in title nor abstract",,"Togia A., Korobili S.",,,,,,"Let's Put Data to Use: Digital Scholarship for the Next Generation -  Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, ELPUB 2014",English,Conference Paper,"18th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, ELPUB 2014",19 June 2014 through 20 June 2014,Thessaloniki,,,,,0,IOS Press,0,9781614994084,2014,0,0,13,22,10.3233/978-1-61499-409-1-13,,,,,2021-01-27

It addresses three questions: How do the higher education systems of Chile, Colombia and Uruguay operate and fund their activities in general? How do existing policies and processes incorporating Open Access and/or OER influence student access to learning and research materials in these countries? What policy, advocacy and community-building interventions might be useful for promoting Open Education activities in these contexts? This study employed a descriptive, case study approach to examine whether and how Open Access and OER policies have been applied at national and institutional levels. It first engaged in an Open Education policy country-mapping exercise, then conducted a comparative analysis, and concluded the research process with a workshop conducted with 10 regional education experts and activists to validate findings. Findings indicate that while each country has its own approach to funding higher education, there are few or no specific national and/or institutional policies aimed at promoting Open Education in the higher education sectors. Low OER awareness and a commercialised model of higher education appear to account for the lack of any OER policies in Chile, while in Colombia various national and institutional strategies reveal a country at a nascent stage of Open Education policy development. By contrast, the nature of OER management and extent of policy implementation in Uruguay suggests that it is an enabling environment for current and future open policy development. ⊓ 121 Adoption and Impact of OER in the Global South 122 All of these countries are making investments in science, technology and innovation programmes and projects, making this the most fruitful field for potential Open Education advocacy. Based on the outcomes of this study, a number of recommendations are proposed, including: fostering and strengthening networks among Latin American civil society organisations promoting Open Education; engaging with higher education stakeholders on how to develop open policies; promoting open policies and mandates for publicly funded research; developing bottom-up and top-down strategies for greater engagement with OER; and providing greater visibility to existing Open Education projects in the region.

While teaching encapsulates all the activities that transfer knowledge, research incorporates the participation in research projects, as well as the authoring of research publications. By measuring the efficiency in the various research activities, the overall academic research impact can be determined. Especially nowadays, that the open data related to research have been amplified in terms of volume, quality and diversity, it is imperative to create and support systems that host and present this kind of information. A variety of information can be derived by research open data, which have many different uses. The advertisement of the institutions' research outputs and the recommendation of research publications based on the already existing publications of the faculty are only some of the possible uses of this information. In this paper, we propose an information system that utilizes open data in order to bring to the fore the research influence of academia and guide the research policy makers. Furthermore, we present a case study with open data derived from engineering faculties to showcase the research impact of the selected faculties and the capabilities of the developed research information system, the e-Research system.

The study found that the students’ respondents are aware of open access resources and use them daily because these resources saves time and provides literature for their research work. Despite the associated benefits students derive from open access resources, there are challenges in accessing and using them such as inadequate training, unsuitable infrastructures and the resources not containing information in their field of study. Though there are challenges in accessing these resources, availability of information resources makes research writing easy and keeps the students informed of current trends. The Call for open access to information resources have been the declaration of Library associations and most governments.

The study was necessitated by the growing need to have the number of Nigerian scholarly publications increased on the internet and accessible to scholars around the world through the use of open access initiatives. Design/methodology/approach - Academics of two first generation Nigerian universities selected using convenient sampling technique were surveyed using the questionnaire to find out the extent of their awareness and use of open access initiatives as authors and readers of scholarly works. Two hundred and fifty questionnaire copies were distributed in the two universities out of which 189 copies were returned, while 180 copies were found to be useable for the study. Findings - It was revealed that the respondents were aware of the pre-print and open access journal initiatives than the post-print initiative. In terms of the use of open access initiatives, although the study revealed insignificant use among the academics, academics in sciences showed more promise of adopting open access initiative as authors and readers of scholarly resources than their counterparts in the humanities. Research limitations/implications - Unlike studies that assessed specific subject based and institutional repositories that allowed for the search and extraction of depositors' names and characteristics, this particular study relied on respondents' responses as a source of their actual use of open access repositories.

We analyzed total Web of Science-(WoS)-indexed publication output in years 2011-2013 for 67 institutions in which OA was mandated to estimate the mandates' effectiveness: How well did the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of the WoS-indexed articles is actually deposited in each institution's OA repository, and when? We found a small but significant positive correlation (0.18) between the MELIBEA strength score and deposit percentage. For three of the eight MELIBEA conditions (deposit timing, internal use, and opt-outs), one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or latency ([a] immediate deposit required; [b] deposit required for performance evaluation; [c] unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out for deposit requirement). When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula to reflect the empirical association we had found, the score's predictive power for mandate effectiveness doubled (0.36). There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness, but the present findings already suggest that it would be productive for existing and future mandates to adopt the three identified conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness, and thereby the growth of OA.",a=openaccess; a=openpolicies,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=publisher; t=university; t=policy,geo=nonspecific,geo=not clear where selected institutions come from - not mentioned in method-part of paper,,"Vincent-Lamarre, Philippe; Boivin, Jade; Gargouri, Yassine; Lariviere, Vincent; Harnad, Stevan",,,,J,,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,English,Article,,,,,"[Vincent-Lamarre, Philippe; Boivin, Jade; Gargouri, Yassine] Univ Quebec, Succursale Ctr Ville, CP 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Vincent-Lamarre, Philippe] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lariviere, Vincent] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Harnad, Stevan] Univ Quebec, Dept Psychol, Succursale Ctr Ville, CP 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Harnad, Stevan] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",,36,12,WILEY,2330-1635,,2016,67,11,2815,2828,10.1002/asi.23601,,,,,2021-01-27

This is particularly evident in the case of open access information resources. The idea of open access to scientific information resources promotes use of mostly free of charge scientific information resources thus substituting use of fee based access to scientific information resources. Open access has both advantages and disadvantages. Main advantages would be greater visibility of published research, greater accessibility of scientific content in general, higher rates of citations etc. and disadvantages would be questionable quality of peer review, absence of peer review in some cases, charging authors for publishing their articles, lack of long term preservation policy etc. This paper also presents results of a study of use of digital information resources by students enrolled in two university courses at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb over period of three years.

In this short paper we report preliminary findings from a two-year research project investigating the ways and the extent that theory and practice have interacted in the development of open-access (OA) approaches to the publishing and dissemination of research outputs. Based on interviews with practitioners and researchers working on OA related issues, we explore the ways in which theory is (and isn't) of value to practice. We find that while practitioners acknowledge that theory has the potential to improve understanding, bestow credibility on work, and codify existing knowledge about OA, they also perceive it as “mood music” to the practical work of OA, lacking explicit links to action.

We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits.

According to a previous evaluation of 441 biomedical journals articles published in 2000-2014, the biomedical literature largely lacked transparency in important dimensions. Here, we surveyed a random sample of 149 biomedical articles published between 2015 and 2017 and determined the proportion reporting sources of public and/or private funding and conflicts of interests, sharing protocols and raw data, and undergoing rigorous independent replication and reproducibility checks. We also investigated what can be learned about reproducibility and transparency indicators from open access data provided on PubMed. The majority of the 149 studies disclosed some information regarding funding (103, 69.1% [95% confidence interval, 61.0% to 76.3%]) or conflicts of interest (97, 65.1% [56.8% to 72.6%]).

Among the 97 articles in which replication in studies with different data would be pertinent, there were five replication efforts (5.2% [1.9% to 12.2%]). Although clinical trial identification numbers and funding details were often provided on PubMed, only two of the articles without a full text article in PubMed Central that discussed publicly available data at the full text level also contained information related to data sharing on PubMed; none had a conflicts of interest statement on PubMed.

A total of 15 journals that changed their status from closed to open access in 2012 and 2013 were selected for a longitudinal obsolescence investigation. Based on the cumulative citation rate distribution model, two ageing time parameters were identified from the actual citation process to quantify the obsolescence of cited journals. The experimental results show that the journal presents three different obsolete phenomena: Sustainable growth, Oscillatory decline and Flash in the pan. OA does have an impact on the obsolescence characteristics of the journal, which is expressed as an increase in the value of the ageing time parameter for any category of journals during or after their conversion year. But this impact does not necessarily persist over time, especially for the latter two types of journals. And OA does affect readers' concern about the old articles in journals, but this concern may also be short-lived. For journals of Oscillatory decline and Flash in the pan, their recently published articles will be more concerned than old ones, which has directly led to the growth of journal impact factors. For most of the Sustainable growth journals, it has shown a polarization tendency of citation distribution: towards citing more newly and more old publications, which also helps to improve the impact factor of journals. However, there are still a few Sustainable growth journals with their older articles are more likely to receive attention than newly published ones. In addition to extending the ageing trend for these journals, it does not help to improve journal impact factors.

Findings - Currently, one-quarter of the WoS articles is Gold OA articles. Brazil is the most active country in OA publishing, while Russia, India and China have the lowest OA ratios. The OA percentage of Brazil has been decreasing dramatically in recent years, while the OA percentages of China, UK and the Netherlands have been increasing. There also exist huge differences of OA percentages across different subject categories. The percentages of OA articles in biology, life, and health-related areas are high, while those in physics and chemistry-related subject categories are very low. Originality/value - With the availability of large-scale data from WoS, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the Gold OA state of major countries for the first time.

The data for the study was taken from OpenDOAR and Alexa to assess the trends, developments, nature of repositories and global ranking. The findings reveal that Brazil has the highest number of repositories in BRICS and bags first five rankings evaluated by Alexa as far as web traffic is concerned and their repositories show maximum positive upward growth among the BRICS repositories. China though has a less number of repositories; it has the highest number of items hosted in its repositories. Indian repositories show maximum negative growth in global web traffic that signifies a dipping position of Indian repositories within BRICS. Further India achieved 9th rank in global ranking by Alexa which is a matter of concern and needs to be addressed whereas Russia didn't find its place in the top ten ranking and contributes very less number of repositories.

This study aims to identify the core fully OA journals widely used by researchers in the field of physics and evaluate the cited fully OA resources by applying various scientometric parameters to check the credibility of these OA resources. Design/methodology/approach The PhD theses awarded during 2014 in the field of physics and hosted in the institutional repositories of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (CIT) and Stanford University, respectively, were selected and scanned to extract references of sources cited. Later on, Google Scholar was used to identify source journals of the extracted references. Only source journals were selected and analyzed;  rest of other sources were ignored;  accordingly, toll-access and OA journals were segregated, as such the OA-cited journals could be identified. The scientometric performance indicators were used to check the quality of identified core fully OA journal cited by USA researchers in the field of physics. Findings The results of this study show that fully OA resources are sufficiently used by the researchers of top three academic institutions of the world/USA. The study was also successful in identifying the core fully OA journals;  besides it also reveals that these fully OA journals are highly impressive as showed by performance indicators applied. The major finding of the research includes the identification of top ten fully OA journals along with their impact based on different scientometric parameters like number of times cited, impact factor, h-index, immediacy index, impact per publication and Scimago Journal Rank (SJR).

2746,SCOPUS,tamara_heck,Factors influencing publication choice: Why faculty choose open access,0,"Background. In an attempt to identify motivating factors involved in decisions to publish in open access and open archives (OA) journals, individual interviews with biomedical faculty members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) and Duke University, two major research universities, were conducted. The interviews focused on faculty identified as early adopters of OA/free full-text publishing. Methods. Searches conducted in PubMed and PubMed Central identified faculty from the two institutions who have published works in OA/free full-text journals. The searches targeted authors with multiple OA citations during a specified 18 month period. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the most prolific OA authors at each university. Individual interviews attempted to determine whether the authors were aware they published in OA journals, why they chose to publish in OA journals, what factors influenced their publishing decisions, and their general attitude towards OA publishing models. Results & Discussion. Fourteen interviews were granted and completed. Respondents included a fairly even mix of Assistant, Associate and Full professors. Results indicate that when targeting biomedical faculty at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke, speed of publication and copyright retention are unlikely motivating factors or incentives for the promotion of OA publishing. In addition, author fees required by some open access journals are unlikely barriers or disincentives. Conclusion. It appears that publication quality is of utmost importance when choosing publication venues in general, while free access and visibility are specifically noted incentives for selection of OA journals. Therefore, free public availability and increased exposure may not be strong enough incentives for authors to choose open access over more traditional and respected subscription based publications, unless the quality issue is also addressed. © 2007 Warlick and Vaughan; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=med,t=researcher,geo=USA,,,"Warlick S.E., Vaughan K.T.L.",,,,,,Biomedical Digital Libraries,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,71,0,17425581,0,2007,4,0,0,0,10.1186/1742-5581-4-1,,,,,2021-01-27

The purpose of this paper is to characterize the uncertainty experienced by open data consumers with a framework based on economic theory. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on information asymmetry theory about market exchanges, this paper investigates the practical challenges faced by data consumers seeking to reuse open data. An inductive qualitative analysis of over 2,900 questions asked between 2013 and 2018 on an internet forum identified how a community of 15,000 open data consumers expressed uncertainty about data sources. Findings Open data consumers asked direct questions that expressed uncertainty about the availability, interoperability and interpretation of data resources. Questions focused on future value and some requests were devoted to seeking data that matched known sources. The study proposes a data signal framework that explains uncertainty about open data within the context of control and visibility.

The study adopts a psychological perspective to elucidate motivations, capabilities and opportunities for OA publishing among bioscientists in the UK. To identify differences within the discipline, bioscientists with starkly different past practices for disclosing research data and technologies were interviewed. The sampled bioscientists face similar obstacles and enablers in their physical environment, but that their motivations and experience of their social environments differ. One group is strongly motivated by their moral convictions and beliefs in benefits of OA and feels peer pressure related to OA. The other group expresses fewer pro-OA beliefs, holds beliefs demotivating OA publishing, but feels pressure from research funders to adopt it. The former group makes more frequent use of OA publishing, which suggests that only those with strong motivations will work to overcome the social and physical obstacles. The individual differences within the discipline suggest that bioscientists are unlikely to respond to OA policies in the same way and, thus, the appropriateness of one-size-fits-all OA policies is questioned.",a=openaccess,m=interview,d=natscie,t=researcher,geo=GBR,,,"Weckowska, Dagmara M.; Levin, Nadine; Leonelli, Sabina; Dupre, John; Castle, David",,,,J,,PROMETHEUS,English,Article,,,,,"[Weckowska, Dagmara M.] Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Weckowska, Dagmara M.] Univ Edinburgh, Innogen Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Levin, Nadine] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Soc & Genet, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Leonelli, Sabina; Dupre, John] Univ Exeter, Exeter Ctr Study Life Sci Egenis, Exeter, Devon, England; [Leonelli, Sabina; Dupre, John] Univ Exeter, Dept Sociol Philosophy & Anthropol, Exeter, Devon, England; [Castle, David] Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Adm, Victoria, BC, Canada",,54,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",0810-9028,,2017,35,2,111,135,10.1080/08109028.2017.1408289,,,,,2021-01-27
2756,SCOPUS,tamara_heck,Evaluating the relationship between the academic and social impact of open access books based on citation behaviors and social media attention,Open access books; Evaluation; Academic impact; Social impact; Disciplines impact; Altmetrics,"Open access academic achievements include not only papers and journals, but also books, which have become an important achievement for scholars and can be regarded as scholarly critical products. Until recently, books have had a key role in the distribution of knowledge and the main issue is which category of open or non-open access books is more effective in academic society. Thus, this study compares the difference between open access and non-open access books in terms of knowledge distribution. We collected and analyzed data from Twitter, Mendeley, and Dimensions platform, as well as the dataset of all Springer books. Twitter and Mendeley are considered alternative metric indicators, which reflect impacts with citation indicators. Data were analyzed from static and comparative perspectives. Results showed a relationship between academic impact and social impact based on citation and social media attention for OA books, and indicated that open access books boost knowledge distribution in Twitter and Mendeley for the sample of books drawn from Springer under study. Moreover, the open access books have the added advantage of keeping sustained impact for a long time. It is sensible to assess the impact of OA books through knowledge distribution. However, there is no significant correlation between citation and social media attention regarding OA books and also the social and academic impact of books in some disciplines such as Geography, Medicine, and Public Health, Culture, and Media Studies attract more social media attention. According to the analysis, the correlation with citations for the number of mentions on social media is negligible, which indicates that social media measures bear different impacts from citations. However, social impact is similar to the complementary measures which should be considered within the impact evaluation of OA books. Therefore, only when OA books are accessed through the channels of communication can the knowledge contained in books be absorbed to generate impact, and lowering the access barrier does lead to more attention found for OA research papers. The findings demonstrated that the OA books and OA papers do not have similar impacts on the citation. Also, OA books could not attract more citations than non-OA books in some disciplines, which is why open access books have a significant impact on social media attention.",a=openaccess; a=openevaluation,m=biblio,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Wei, Mingkun; Noroozi Chakoli, Abdolreza",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Wei, Mingkun] Hebei Univ, Sch Management, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Noroozi Chakoli, Abdolreza] Shahed Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Knowledge Studies & Scientome, Fac Humanities Sci, Persian Gulf Highway, Tehran 3319118651, Iran",,61,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,125,3,2401,2420,10.1007/s11192-020-03678-0,,,,,2021-01-27

Open data are often associated with realizing ambitions, such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems and increased economic value. There has been ample literature describing the (potential) benefits of open data. However, to switch to an open data policy may pose a challenge to the business model of National Mapping & Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs), especially if they are required to generate sufficient revenue to cover a substantial part of their operating costs. This research aims to assess the effects of open data policies on the business models of NMCAs and which adaptations have been made to cope with revenue losses due to open data supply. In March and April 2017, we surveyed European NMCAs to find out which strategies NMCAs employ to be able to (re)finance operational costs and to ensure long-term sustainability of (open) data. This report provides the initial outcomes of the survey and will provide an input for a workshop on Sustainable Open Data Business Models for NMCAs, to be held 18-19 September 2017 in Delft, The Netherlands. This workshop will bring together the NMCAs to present and share their experiences of open data and discuss the research results with representatives of academia. © 2017, European Spatial Data Research (EuroSDR).

2770,SCOPUS,tamara_heck,Peer review quality and transparency of the peer-review process in open access and subscription journals,0,"Background Recent controversies highlighting substandard peer review in Open Access (OA) and traditional (subscription) journals have increased the need for authors, funders, publishers, and institutions to assure quality of peer-review in academic journals. I propose that transparency of the peer-review process may be seen as an indicator of the quality of peer-review, and develop and validate a tool enabling different stakeholders to assess transparency of the peer-review process. Methods and Findings Based on editorial guidelines and best practices, I developed a 14-item tool to rate transparency of the peer-review process on the basis of journals' websites. In Study 1, a random sample of 231 authors of papers in 92 subscription journals in different fields rated transparency of the journals that published their work. Authors' ratings of the transparency were positively associated with quality of the peer-review process but unrelated to journal's impact factors. In Study 2, 20 experts on OA publishing assessed the transparency of established (non-OA) journals, OA journals categorized as being published by potential predatory publishers, and journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Results show high reliability across items (a = .91) and sufficient reliability across raters. Ratings differentiated the three types of journals well. In Study 3, academic librarians rated a random sample of 140 DOAJ journals and another 54 journals that had received a hoax paper written by Bohannon to test peer-review quality. Journals with higher transparency ratings were less likely to accept the flawed paper and showed higher impact as measured by the h5 index from Google Scholar. Conclusions The tool to assess transparency of the peer-review process at academic journals shows promising reliability and validity. The transparency of the peer-review process can be seen as an indicator of peer-review quality allowing the tool to be used to predict academic quality in new journals. © 2016 Jelte M. Wicherts.

This becomes more complicated as the selection criteria may vary from one discipline to another. Therefore, appropriate cross-disciplinary studies are required to understand the exact concerns that dominate a particular field. The current study compares 16 factors that influence journal choices between medicine and social sciences using the answers given to a global survey of 235 open access journal authors. The results reveal that authors of both areas consider ''peer reviewed' status as the most important factor while showing the least interest to the number of annual subscribers' of the journal. However, compared to social science authors, those in the discipline of medicine give significantly more consideration to (1) impact factor, (2) the inclusion of the journal in abstracting and indexing services, (3) publisher's prestige, and (4) online submission with tracking facility. The factors that were identified can be categorized for both disciplines as reflecting the reputation of a journal, performance or production issues, and reliability and demand characteristics of their publication choice. The editors and publishers can use these findings to attract the best manuscripts as the study reveals the author's perception of the journal's status.

Our key finding is that transformative agreements emerge as the most promising model because they offer a predictable, steady funding stream. We also facilitated pilot transformative agreement negotiations between several society publishers and library consortia. These pilots and a workshop of consortium representatives and society publishers informed the development of an OA transformative agreement toolkit. Our conclusion is that society publishers should consider all the business models this project has developed and should not automatically equate OA with article publication charges.",a=openaccess,m=interview; m=survey,d=socscie,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,n for interviews not clear,,"Wise, Alicia; Estelle, Lorraine",,,,J,,LEARNED PUBLISHING,English,Article,,,,,"[Wise, Alicia; Estelle, Lorraine] Informat Power Ltd, Winchester, Hants, England",,9,4,WILEY,0953-1513,,2020,33,1,14,27,10.1002/leap.1272,,,,32089590,2021-01-27

Citation principles encourage authors to provide full descriptions of objects, with stable links, in their papers. As Jupyter notebooks (JNs) aggregate data, software, and other objects, they may facilitate or hinder citation, credit, and access to data and software. We report on a study of references to JNs in astronomy over a five-year period (2014-2018). References increased rapidly, but fewer than half of the references led to JNs that could be located and opened. JNs appear better suited to supporting the research process than to providing access to research objects. We recommend that authors cite individual data and software objects and that they stabilize any notebooks cited in publications.

This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9%); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81% of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers' comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.",a=openevaluation,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Wolfram, Dietmar; Wang, Peiling; Hembree, Adam; Park, Hyoungjoo",,,,J,,SCIENTOMETRICS,English,Article,,,,,"[Wolfram, Dietmar; Park, Hyoungjoo] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Informat Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Wang, Peiling; Hembree, Adam] Univ Tennessee, Sch Informat Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,50,0,SPRINGER,0138-9130,,2020,125,2,1033,1051,10.1007/s11192-020-03488-4,,,,,2021-01-27

Both maps and tables are used to support the analysis. The diffusionist theory is reviewed and applied to the understanding of open access. Findings - The paper discovers that technology is not the only factor determining the diffusion pattern of information systems as discussed in the literature. Cultural dissimilarities across countries have played a significant role in open access development. Open access can only be effectively established after it meets local standards. Practical implications - The findings help understanding of why open access has a disproportionate growth among developing countries, and even among developed countries, where the ICT infrastructure has been in place.

The questionnaire survey was proceeded and informed by two focus groups attended by two dozen Chinese researchers. The findings showed that Chinese researchers appeared lukewarm on the topic of OA journals as a whole. The quantitative research showed that some of them liked the principle of OA, but many were suspicious and confused about OA publications. In terms of diversity, younger researchers and biologists/life scientists were more in favor of publishing in OA journals. The biggest misunderstanding about OA journals is that Chinese scholars confused OA with the who-pays-will-get-published model which comes without peer review.

In terms of citations and altmetric indexes, the mean value of the USA is larger than that of China in general; Type II articles possess the highest value among all papers in the USA, whereas Type III has the highest value in China. Compared with the scenario in citations, social sciences and humanities possess larger altmetric values in China and the USA. The correlation among indicators is similar for the OA papers from China and the USA. Generally, citations cannot effectively represent the altmetric indexes.

Human life has been diversely changed due to the volume expansion of information handling and distribution. The rapid growth and informatization of information and communications technology (ICT) could be the driver of the production and distribution of information in the real world. Also, it has greatly influenced the economy, politics, society, culture, etc. As the value of information continues to increase, all governments around the world are becoming more and more interested in the reaction to the provision of information. The people need liberty and equality in the environment for the acquisition or utilization of necessary information. Especially due to the importance of the information sharing system, both the government and people are greatly interested in the information sharing policy of the government. Information sharing policies around the world greatly affect people. They disclose information (from government agencies, local government units, public institutions, etc.) to people. However, in the case of national research institutes, their information sharing policy has been ineffective due to the specialty of their work and data. Also, their data are not at the general information sharing level. In this paper, first, the information science policy for public open data of national research institutes is presented and discussed. First, we will look for an efficient method of information sharing policy-making for national research institutes.

In addition, the paper seeks to discuss measurement methods beyond citation analysis. Design/methodology/approach - The study selected 97 LIS OA journals as a sample and measured their scholarly impact on the basis of citations and links. The citation counts in WoS, coverage in LISA, Web links, WIFs and Page Rank of the journals are retrieved and calculated, and correlations between citation counts, links, pages, WIFs, and Page Rank are also analyzed. Findings - The results indicate that LIS OA journals have become a significant component of the scholarly communication system. The Journal of the Medical Library Association enjoys the highest citation counts in WoS. This journal, together with D-Lib Magazine, Information Research, Ariadne, Cybermetrics, and First Monday are the six most important LIS OA journals.

Statistics of this Fund have shown that funding covers publications mainly in health sciences. These findings have allowed us to implement a new policy for the financing of Open Access publications from our university's budget, which falls within the framework of its social responsibility. However, considering the ""hybrid model"" and the ""double dipping"" which favors 'big' publishers, we will examine the different possibilities and present our reflections and decision for the new policy. Finally we will describe the policy implemented. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.",a=openaccess; a=openpolicies,m=other,d=med,t=librarian; t=publisher,geo=GRC,"empirical?

The lack of library resources and the unfriendly repository user interface are two significant barriers that hinder green open access. Tasked to implement the open access mandate, librarians at an American research university developed a comprehensive system called Easy Deposit 2 to automate the support workflow of green open access. Easy Deposit 2 is a web application that is able to harvest new publications, to source manuscripts on behalf of the library, and to facilitate self-archiving to a university's institutional repository. The article deposit rate increased from 7.40% to 25.60% with the launch of Easy Deposit 2. The results show that a computer system can implement routine tasks to support green open access with success. Recent developments in digital repository provide new opportunities for innovation, such as Easy Deposit 2, in supporting open access.

We used bibliographic data from the Web of Science to find out how CIHR-funded researchers in the physical sciences self-archived their publications. We also examined the self-archiving policies of the journals in which the researchers published, and compared the citation rates of two different self-archiving approaches: the green open access route (deposit in an institutional or subject repository) and the grey open access route (deposit in an academic social network or personal/departmental website). Only 14% of the articles were openly accessible through the green open access route, while 37% could be accessed through the grey open access route. We cannot ascribe the low uptake of green open access to publishers' self-archiving policies, as almost all journals allowed self-archiving through the green open access route. Authors deposited 31% of their publications in ResearchGate, the most popular self-archiving option in our study, while they deposited only 2.1% of their publications in institutional repositories, the least popular option.

Citation rates were comparable for green open access and non-open access articles, but citation rates for gold open access articles were lower. After controlling for publication year, citation rates of gold, green, and non -open access articles were comparable. Among gold open access articles, citation rates were highest for open access journals with article processing charges, but after controlling for publication year, articles published in hybrid journals, followed by those in open access journals with article processing charges, achieved the highest citation rates.

It was first published in the year 2009 and is currently celebrating tenth year of publications. In this research, a bibliometric analysis of RS OAJ was conducted based on 5588 articles published during the 10-year (2009-2018) time-period. The bibliometric analysis includes a comprehensive set of indicators such as dynamics and trends of publications, journal impact factor, total cites, eigenfactor score, normalized eigenfactor, CiteScore, h-index, h-classic publications, most productive countries (or territories) and institutions, co-authorship collaboration about countries (territories), research themes, citation impact of co-occurrences keywords, intellectual structure, and knowledge commutation. We found that publications of RS OAJ presented an exponential growth in the past ten years. From 2010 to 2017 (for which complete years data were available), the h-index of RS OAJ is 67. From 2009-2018, RS OAJ includes publications from 129 countries (or territories) and 3826 institutions. The leading nations contributing articles, based on 2009-2018 data, and listed based on ranking were: China, United States, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Canada, England, Australia, Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland and Austria. The leading institutions, also for the same period and listed based on ranking were: Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Normal University, The university of Maryland, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, China University of Geosciences, United States Geological Survey, German Aerospace Centre, University of Twente, and California Institute of Technology. For the year 2017, RS OAJ had an impressive journal impact factor of 3.4060, a CiteScore of 4.03, eigenfactor score of 0.0342, and normalized eigenfactor score of 3.99. In addition, based on 2009-2018, data co-word analysis determined that remote sensing, MODIS, Landsat, LiDAR and NDVI are the high-frequency of author keywords co-occurrence in RS OAJ. The main themes of RS OAJ are multi-spectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, LiDAR scanning and forestry remote sensing monitoring, MODIS and LAI data applications, Remote sensing applications and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Through author keywords citation impact analysis, we find the most influential keyword is Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), followed, forestry, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), terrestrial laser scanning, airborne laser scanning, forestry inventory, urban heat island, monitoring, agriculture, and laser scanning. By analyzing the intellectual structure of RS OAJ, we identify the main reference publications and find that the themes are about Random Forests, MODIS vegetation indices and image analysis, etc. RS OAJ ranks first in cited journals and third in citing, this indicates that RS OAJ has the internal knowledge flow. Our results will bring more benefits to scholars, researchers and graduate students, who hopes to get a quick overview of the RS OAJ. And this article will also be the starting point for communication between scholars and practitioners. Finally, this paper proposed a nuanced h-index (nh-index) to measure productivity and intellectual contribution of authors by considering h-index based on whether the one is first, second, third, or nth author. This nuanced approach to determining h-index of authors is powerful indicator of an academician's productivity and intellectual contribution.",a=openaccess; a=openevaluation,m=biblio,d=socscie,t=publisher,geo=nonspecific,d=remotesensing;n=articles,,"Zhang, YuYing; Thenkabail, Prasad S.; Wang, Peng",,,,J,,REMOTE SENSING,English,Article,,,,,"[Zhang, YuYing] Dalian Univ, Fac Educ, Dalian 116622, Peoples R China; [Thenkabail, Prasad S.] USGS, WGSC, 2255 N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Wang, Peng] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,90,8,MDPI,,,2019,11,1,,,10.3390/rs11010091,,,,,2021-01-27

With the recent open-science movement, there has been a call for free access to data, tools and methods in academia. In recent years, subject-based and institutional repositories and data centres have emerged along with online publishing. Many scientific records, including published articles and data, have been made available via new platforms. In the United Kingdom, most major research funders had a data policy and require researchers to include a 'data-sharing plan' when applying for funding. However, there are a number of barriers to the full-scale adoption of data sharing. Those barriers are not only technical, but also psychological and social. A survey was conducted with over 1800 UK-based academics to explore the extent of support of data sharing and the characteristics and factors associated with data-sharing practice. It found that while most academics recognised the importance of sharing research data, most of them had never shared or reused research data. There were differences in the extent of data sharing between different gender, academic disciplines, age and seniority. It also found that the awareness of Research Council UK's (RCUK) Open-Access (OA) policy, experience of Gold and Green OA publishing, attitudes towards the importance of data sharing and experience of using secondary data were associated with the practice of data sharing. A small group of researchers used social media such as Twitter, blogs and Facebook to promote the research data they had shared online.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of socio-communication strategies on innovation capacity based on experiments using a general-purpose model that aims to study dynamic processes of collective creativity in scientific communities. Experimental results indicate that low communication frequency, openness and receptivity lead to higher variety. On the contrary, variety decreases with increasing receptivity under high communication frequency. If more communication channels exist, the connectivity-driven preferential attachment strategy is beneficial in fostering innovation in terms of generated networks with low density and high centrality. Additionally, balance theory suggests higher levels of knowledge diffusion efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.",a=openscience,m=other,d=engtech; d=med,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,uploaded paper; m = mathematical modelling of impacts; about collaborative platforms; discuss whether open science in the sense of the survey ,,"Zou G., Yilmaz L.",,,,,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,1,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10834427,0,2016,46,2,271,281,10.1109/TSMC.2015.2455956,,,,,2021-01-27
2918,SCOPUS,tamara_heck,Open access and civic scientific information literacy,0,"Introduction: We examine how residents and citizens of The Netherlands perceive open access to acquire preliminary insight into the role it might play in cultivating civic scientific literacy. Open access refers to scientific or scholarly research literature available on the Web to scholars and the general public in free online journals and institutional repositories. Method: Four focus group sessions were held at a conference centre near Amsterdam. Participants were between the ages of twenty-one to sixty and grouped on the basis of age and educational background. All were invited to complete a brief digital literacy and information literacy questionnaire, and contribute to a set of ranking and vignette exercises designed to encourage discussion. Results: Participants generally agreed that open access literature could be useful for personal decision making and conveyed an interest in medical treatment research and other research 'that has to do with people.' Some concern was expressed about the cognitive accessibility of scientific research, but participants were confident that they had the online search skills to find this literature. Science journalists were appreciated for their role as interpreters; however, universities and scholars were considered more credible as information sources, though some participants wondered if scientists and scholars were making their work visible enough to the lay public. Conclusions: Current science policy in The Netherlands is focused on motivating young people to raise their interest in science and technology and engage in science-related careers. We recommend the introduction in schools of strategic e-learning programmes designed to help young citizens develop a greater appreciation for scholarly and scientific research and improve their capacity to make decisions as online information consumers. © the author.",a=openaccess,m=interview;m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=other,geo=NLD,t=civilists,,Zuccala A.,,,,,,Information Research,English,Article,0,0,0,,,,,18,0,13681613,0,2010,15,1,0,0,,,,,,2021-01-27

In Europe policies at the European, national, ministerial and local level exist. Although plans of the Dutch government are in the making, the Netherlands is still lacking a clear and detailed national open data policy. Furthermore, most of the existing international directives for open public data policies are general by nature. Hence, there may be large differences among open data policies. Up to now there is limited systematic and structured research conducted on differences of open data policies. In this policy paper, a comparison is made of the open data policies of the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Interviews and a review of reports showed that there are differences between the open data policies of the two Dutch ministries with regard to guidelines for opening up data, the type and amount of data that were actually opened up and the way this was done.

The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. However, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies.

Although each discipline has unique challenges and characteristics which can influence data sharing and re-use behavior, it may be possible to gain transferable insight from disciplines where these practices are more common. Several studies of the motivations underlying data sharing and re-use have been conducted, however these studies often remain at a high level of abstraction rather than providing in-depth insight about discipline-specific challenges and opportunities. This study sought to provide in-depth insight about the complex interaction of factors influencing motivations for sharing and re-using open research data within a single discipline, namely astrophysics. We focused on this discipline due to its well-developed tradition of free and open access to research data. Eight factors were found to influence researchers' motivations for sharing data openly, including the researcher's background, personal drivers, experience, legislation, regulation and policy, data characteristics, performance expectancy, usability, and collaboration. We identified six factors that influence researchers' motivations to re-use open research data, including the researcher's background, facilitating conditions, expected performance, social and affiliation factors, effort and experience.

Yet, it is still unclear, how the concept of open science is integrating scholarly debates and as to whether it has established structures similar to other scientific fields or debates. Against this backdrop, we have attempted to study the scholarly discourse of Open Science by using bibliometric and network analysis tools. Our goal was to determine how the open science discourse has evolved over time, how it is structured and how the different associated terms relate to other. In order to evaluate as to whether Open Science has evolved into an established scientific topic, we have attempted to compare OS with another concept which propagates openness in innovation and research, that is, Open Innovation. We found that Open Science and Open Innovation are rising topics within the scholarly discourse. Yet, we have also found that the Open Science keyword network is only sparsely connected internally and the different realms in the Open Science keyword network, such as Open Access, Open Data or Data Sharing are only scarcely connected to each other. Furthermore, we could show that Open Science has so far not developed strong ties to other scholarly debates.

We do so by examining participation in CONECT-e, a CS project that uses a wiki-like platform to document traditional ecological knowledge. More precisely, we analyze quantitative data on participants’ profile and activity patterns and qualitative data on barriers and drivers of participation. Our findings suggest that overcoming the education, age, and residence participation barriers is challenging even in cocreated CS projects. This is potentially due to issues of perceived self-illegitimacy and low access to information and communication technologies. Our results also point out that participants’ alliance with the project’s objectives and trust relationships with the project team are important drivers of participation in CS projects. Finally, we also highlight the need to think beyond participation as single actions and rather consider participation diversity in CS as functional diversity in ecosystems, with participants performing a diverse set of interconnected tasks or functions.",a=openparticipation ,m=document review; m=interview,d=natscie,t=other,geo=ESP,a=citizenscience; m=document analysis; d=ecology,,"Benyei, Petra; Pardo-de-Santayana,Manuel; Aceituno-Mata, Laura; Calvet-Mir, Laura; Carrascosa-García, María; Rivera-Ferre, Marta; Perdomo-Molina, Antonio; Reyes-García, Victoria",,,,J,,"Science, Technology, & Human Values",English,Article,,,,,,,,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,0162-2439,,2020,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243920948110,,,,,2021-04-16
2938,ZOTERO,tamara_heck,Open Up: A Survey on Open and Non-anonymized Peer Reviewing,,"We present a discussion and analysis regarding the benefits and limitations of open and non-anonymized peer review based on literature results and responses to a survey on the reviewing process of alt.chi, a more or less open-review track within the CHI conference, the predominant conference in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). This track currently is the only implementation of an open-peer-review process in the field of HCI while, with the recent increase in interest in open science practices, open review is now being considered and used in other fields. We collected 30 responses from alt.chi authors and reviewers and found that, while the benefits are quite clear and the system is generally well liked by alt.chi participants, they are reluctant to see it used in other venues. This concurs with a number of recent studies that suggest a divergence between support for a more open review process and its practical implementation.

Discussions about changes in practices such as posting data and pre-registering analyses have been marked by controversy—including controversy over the extent to which change has taken place. This study, based on the State of Social Science (3S) Survey, provides the first com-prehensive assessment of awareness of, attitudes towards, perceived norms regarding, and adoption of open science practices within a broadly representative sample of scholars from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and so-ciology. We observe a steep increase in adoption: as of 2017, over 80% of scholars had used at least one such practice, rising from one quarter a decade earlier. Attitudes toward research transpar-ency are on average similar between older and younger scholars, but the pace of change di˙ers by field and methodology. According with theories of normal science and scientific change, the timing of increases in adoption coincides with technological innovations and institutional policies. Patterns are consistent with most scholars underestimating the trend toward open science in their discipline.",a=opendata; a=openmethod,m=survey,d=socscie,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,,,"Christensen, Garret; Wang, Zenan; Levy Paluck, Elizabeth; Swanson, Nicholas; Birke, David; Miguel, Edward; Littman, Rebecca",,,,J,,UC Berkeley: Center for Effective Global Action,English,Article,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0hx0207r,,,,,2021-04-16

2941,ZOTERO,tamara_heck,What Drives Academic Data Sharing?,,"Despite widespread support from policy makers, funding agencies, and scientific journals, academic researchers rarely make their research data available to others. At the same time, data sharing in research is attributed a vast potential for scientific progress. It allows the reproducibility of study results and the reuse of old data for new research questions. Based on a systematic review of 98 scholarly papers and an empirical survey among 603 secondary data users, we develop a conceptual framework that explains the process of data sharing from the primary researcher’s point of view. We show that this process can be divided into six descriptive categories: Data donor, research organization, research community, norms, data infrastructure, and data recipients. Drawing from our findings, we discuss theoretical implications regarding knowledge creation and dissemination as well as research policy measures to foster academic collaboration. We conclude that research data cannot be regarded as knowledge commons, but research policies that better incentivise data sharing are needed to improve the quality of research results and foster scientific progress.",a=opendata,m=document review; m=survey,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=DEU,,,"Fecher, B.; Friesike, S.; Hebing, M.",,,,J,,PLOS ONE,English,Article,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,10,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118053,,,,,2021-04-16

Detailed data on the decisions of 1694 bio-scientists allow to detect similarities and differences between academia-based and industry-based scientists. Arguments from social capital theory are applied to explain why individuals share information even at (temporary) personal cost. In both realms, the results suggest that the likelihood of sharing decreases with the competitive value of the requested information. Factors related to social capital, i.e., expected reciprocity and the extent to which a scientist's community conforms to the norm of open science, either directly affect information-sharing or moderate competitive interest considerations on information-sharing. The effect depends on the system to which a scientist belongs.",a=opendata; a=openmethod,m=survey,d=natscie; d=engtech,t=researcher;t=practitioner,geo=DEU; geo=GBR,"a= ""information sharing""",,"Haeussler, Carolin",,,,J,,Research Policy,English,Article,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,2011,40,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2010.08.00,,,,,2021-04-16

However, the relative effectiveness of these different interventions has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a robust, transparent and updateable method for analysing how these interventions affect the open access performance of individual institutes. We studied 1,207 institutions from across the world, and found that, in 2017, the top-performing universities published around 80-90% of their research open access. The analysis also showed that publisher-mediated (gold) open access was popular in Latin American and African universities, whereas the growth of open access in Europe and North America has mostly been driven by repositories.",a=openaccess; a=openpolicies,m=biblio; m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=university,geo=nonspecific,n=university,,"Huang, Chun-Kai; Neylon, Cameron; Hosking, Richard; Montgomery, Lucy; Wilson, Katie S;  Ozaygen, Alkim; Brookes-Kenworthy, Chloe",,,,J,,eLife,English,Article,,,,,,,,,eLife,,,2020,,,,,doi: 10.7554/eLife.57067,,,,,2021-04-16

This research employed Ostrom's (2003) theory of collective action to better understand scientists' data sharing behaviors from the perspective of cooperation in a community. This research empirically evaluated the research model and related hypotheses by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method on a total of 456 survey responses from biologists in the U.S. The results suggest that biologists' perceived academic reputation significantly increases their perceived community trust, norm of data sharing, and academic reciprocity. Along with perceived academic reputation, both perceived community trust and norms of data sharing also significantly increases biologists' academic reciprocity in data sharing. This research also found that biologists' academic reciprocity and norms of data sharing significantly affect their data sharing intentions. The results of this research show that the theory of collective action provides new insight to scientists' data sharing behaviors.

This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research.

2947,ZOTERO,tamara_heck,Open Access Issues and Engineering Faculty Attitudes and Practices,,"The two primary means for accomplishing Open Access (OA) goals are the “author pays” or Gold model and the “self-archiving” or Green model, both of which can have variations or hybrids. There is a growing schism between proponents of the Gold and Green models. Scholar uptake on self-archiving has been very limited. At the same time, a great deal of concern has been expressed regarding the Gold model, particularly with regard to cost and the role of peer-review lite journals. With the evolving OA environment as a backdrop, the authors conducted a survey of university engineering faculty in order to better understand their OA practices and attitudes. The scholarly communication needs and activities of engineering faculty are more diverse than other scholars in that they have a broader and more varied literature, which includes journal articles, conference papers, technical reports, standards, handbook information, patents, and grey literature. The survey was comprised of 12 Likert scale questions and 3 open comment questions. The results of the survey of engineering faculty were consistent with other studies that have revealed concerns over the author pays model and a reluctance to self-archive in the university institutional repository (IR). Survey results showed that engineering faculty do not extensively publish in author pays Gold journals and had limited plans to do so in the future. In line with other studies, the survey revealed that there was a lack of familiarity with campus IRs and a very small uptake rate for depositing research output in institutional repositories.",a=openaccess; a=opendata,m=survey,d=engtech,t=researcher,geo=USA,,,"Mischo, William H.; Schlembach , Mary C.

I help fill this gap in the literature by presenting a descriptive case study that illustrates the variety of open and sharing practices enacted by faculty members at a North American university. Open and sharing practices enacted at this institution revolve around publishing manuscripts in open ways, participating on social media, creating and using open educational resources, and engaging with open teaching. This examination finds that certain open practices are favored over others. Results also show that even though faculty members often share scholarly materials online for free, they frequently do so without associated open licenses (i.e. without engaging in open practices). These findings suggest that individual motivators may significantly affect the practice of openness, but that environmental factors (e.g., institutional contexts) and technological elements (e.g., YouTube’s default settings) may also shape open practices in unanticipated ways.",a=openaccess; a=opendata;  a=openeducation,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=USA,m=document analysis; data analysis,,"Veletsianos, George",,,,,,Open Praxis,English,Article,,,,,,,,,icde,2304-070X,,2015,7,3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5944/openpraxis.7.3.206,,,,,2021-04-21

The resulting definition “Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks” helps the scientific community, the business world, political actors, and citizens to have a common and clear understanding about what Open Science is, and stimulates an open debate about the social, economic, and human added value of this phenomenon.",a=openscience,m=document review,d=nonspecific,t=researcher,geo=nonspecific,discuss Group - need to introduce t=none to signify unspecific target group? ,,"Vicente-Saez, Ruben; Martinez-Fuentes, Clara",,,,,,Journal of Business Research,English,Article,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,2018,88,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.12.043,,,,,2021-04-21
